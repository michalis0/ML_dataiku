5	31-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Love my Echo!	1
5	31-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Loved it!	1
4	31-Jul-18	Walnut Finish 	"Sometimes while playing a game, you can answer a question correctly but Alexa says you got it wrong and answers the same as you.  I like being able to turn lights on and off while away from home."	1
5	31-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"I have had a lot of fun with this thing. My 4 yr old learns about dinosaurs, i control the lights and play games like categories. Has nice sound when playing music as well."	1
5	31-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Music	1
5	31-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"I received the echo as a gift. I needed another Bluetooth or something to play music easily accessible, and found this smart speaker. Can’t wait to see what else it can do."	1
3	31-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"Without having a cellphone, I cannot use many of her features. I have an iPad but do not see that of any use.  It IS a great alarm.  If u r almost deaf, you can hear her alarm in the bedroom from out in the living room, so that is reason enough to keep her.It is fun to ask random questions to hear her response.  She does not seem to be very smartbon politics yet."	1
5	31-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I think this is the 5th one I've purchased. I'm working on getting one in every room of my house. I really like what features they offer specifily playing music on all Echos and controlling the lights throughout my house.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	looks great	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"Love it! I’ve listened to songs I haven’t heard since childhood! I get the news, weather, information! It’s great!"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"I sent it to my 85 year old Dad, and he talks to it constantly."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I love it! Learning knew things with it eveyday! Still figuring out how everything works but so far it's been easy to use and understand. She does make me laugh at times	1
5	30-Jul-18	Oak Finish 	"I purchased this for my mother who is having knee problems now, to give her something to do while trying to over come not getting around so fast like she did.She enjoys all the little and big things it can do...Alexa play this song, What time is it and where, and how to cook this and that!"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"Love, Love, Love!!"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Oak Finish 	Just what I expected....	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"I love it, wife hates it."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Really happy with this purchase.  Great speaker and easy to set up.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	We have only been using Alexa for a couple of days and are having a lot of fun with our new toy. It like having a new household member! We are trying to learn all the different featues and benefits that come with it.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	We love the size of the 2nd generation echo. Still needs a little improvement on sound	1
4	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"I liked the original Echo. This is the same but shorter and with greater fabric/color choices. I miss the volume ring on top, now it's just the plus/minus buttons. Not a big deal but the ring w as comforting. :) Other than that, well I do like the use of a standard USB charger /port instead of the previous round pin. Other than that, I guess it sounds the same, seems to work the same, still answers to Alexa/Echo/Computer. So what's not to like? :)"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Love the Echo and how good the music sounds playing off it. Alexa understands most commands but it is difficult at times for her to find specific playlists or songs on Spotify. She is good with Amazon Music but is lacking in other major programs.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"We love Alexa! We use her to play music, play radio through iTunes, play podcasts through Anypod, and set reminders. We listen to our flash briefing of news and weather every morning. We rely on our custom lists. We like being able to voice control the volume. We're sure we'll continue to find new uses.Sometimes it's a bit frustrating when Alexa doesn't understand what we're saying."	1
4	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"Have only had it set up for a few days. Still adding smart home devices to it. The speaker is great for playing music. I like the size, we have it stationed on the kitchen counter and it’s not intrusive to look at."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I love it. It plays my sleep sounds immediately when I ask	1
3	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"I got a second unit for the bedroom, I was expecting the sounds to be improved but I didnt really see a difference at all.  Overall, not a big improvement over the 1st generation."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	Amazing product	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"I love my Echo. It's easy to operate, loads of fun.It is everything as advertised. I use it mainly to play my favorite tunes and test Alexa's knowledge."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Sounds great!! Love them!	1
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"Fun item to play with and get used to using.  Sometimes has hard time answering the questions you ask, but I think it will be better."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Just like the other one	1
5	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	Still learning all the capabilities...but so far pretty pretty pretty good	1
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I like it	1
5	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"She works well. Needs a learning command  for unique, owners and users like. Alexa “learn” Tasha’s birthday.  Or Alexa “learn” my definition of Fine. Etc. other than that she is great"	1
3	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	The speakers sound pretty good for being so small and setup is pretty easy.  I bought two and the reason I only rate it a 3 is I have followed the instructions for synching music to both units.  I know I've done it correctly but they won't sync.  That was my primary motivation for purchasing multiple units.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	This device is awesome!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I bought this to compare the speaker quality to our first generation speaker and i like the sound better.  I will ship this to my daughter though because I like the fact that my first generation has a chargeable base that we bought which keeps it more mobile and she needs a better sound than what she has now.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"Love my Echo. Still learning all the things it will do. Wasn’t able to follow instructions included in the package, but found a great one on U-Tube."	1
4	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Speaker is better than 1st generation Echo	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"This thing is way cool!  You should get one.  If you want to be cool, that is."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"This is my first digital assistant so I'm giving this a good review. Speaker is really good for the cheap price on Prime day. Fun to play with and can be used as an alarm clock (That's what I was going to get in the first place, but I ended up with Echo). If you haven't had a go with one then definitely try it!What I like best is the number of other devices that it can connect with. My purchase came with a Smart Plug for $10 which I connect my lamp to. Alexa, turn of the lights!"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	My husband likes being able to use it to listen to music.  I wish we knew all it's capabilities	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"My Android would not allow Alexa to connect. Fortunately, my sister was here with her Apple cell. After an hour+ tech support fixed the glitches. We are up and running."	1
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	So far so good	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Tried to play certain broadway shows like Camelot and it gives ne the group Camelot.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	Great	1
5	30-Jul-18	Walnut Finish 	Very satisfied with the Echo. Alexa now controls the lights in my family room and my wife can listen to Jimmy Buffet by just asking Alexa.	1
2	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"It's like Siri, in fact, Siri answers more accurately then Alexa.  I don't see a real need for it in my household, though it was a good bargain on prime day deals."	0
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Love my Echo. Still learning how every thing works but having tons of fun.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	I love you so much	1
3	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	No different than Apple. To play a specific list of music you must have an Amazon of Spotify “plus/prime/etc” account.  So you must pay to play “your” music.  3 stars for that reason.  Everything else is 👍🏻 .	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"Excelente, lo unico es que no esta en español."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"I'm still learning how to use it, but so far my Echo is great! The sound is actually much better than I was expecting."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Works as you’d expect and then some. Also good sound quality considering price (70.00 on sale) and features.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	The sound from this Echo 2nd Generation is phenomenal!  Not to mention that I just love Alexa!  She is very helpful.	1
3	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	like google better	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Just had to have it and now lets play and learn how to get the most out of it.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Works as advertised. Very easy to setup. Still learning what this can do.	1
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Great sound and easy to set up.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Oak Finish 	"Love Alexa, bought others for friends"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Love the echo I purchased it for company for my husband he is 83 and Alexa is great all he has to do is say her name and she tells him a joke and plays his favorite songs	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	😍	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Love being able to listen to music easily. Still learning all the features available	1
4	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"Did t really know what I could use this device for. Used it for a few things, but need an overview"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Love this just wish it had a built in hub	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I use it primarily to play music.  It works wonderfully!  Still getting used to some of the many things it will do.  Amazon has sent several tips since I got it. Thanks for all your help!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	How easy if was to set up.	1
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Fast response which was amazing.  Clear concise answers and sound quality is fantastic.  I am still getting used to Alexia and have not usde Echo to its full extent.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	You’re all I need...na na nana!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Does everything as expected and more.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"I love my Echo!  Works just like they said it would. I don't have a &#34;smart&#34; home, so I cannot speak about that function, but everything else about it is good."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Great sound in a small package—easy to set up and use; fun to own.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Works and sounds great.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	The sound is amazing and many collections of all music	1
4	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	Setting up	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	She doesn’t always listen	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	It’s awesome	1
4	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"I bought this because it can control fios television. It works well. I’m hoping over time it will do more to control fios. Then I discovered all the other things Alexa can do. Play music you ask for. Great sound from Alexa. Play games. Play radio stations. Play old time radio programs like the Long Ranger. Alexa has many “apps” you can add to her abilities. The other day I played Madlibs. Great fun. Also Alexa can control household appliances. I just purchased Alexa compatible power strips to control lighting, fans and TV components. I’m looking forward to implementing this controll. You can also add other Alexa components to have chosen music to play in all rooms where the components are located."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	The speaker has excellent sound and works perfectly!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I LIKE IT ALL	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I love it. It does everything	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	I was a little nervous when I received my new Echo as I'm not really Tech savvy. I found it a bit intimidating at first but it didn't take me to long to figure it out!! I'm very happy with my purchase and now thinking of adding an echo spot!!!	1
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I like it and still learning how to use it.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Great technology!! Can't believe the speaker volume and quality is so wonderful. Wish I had bought another one!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"I purchased an echo dot for my husband for Fathers Day.  He uses it constantly and after hearing the quality of sound of the Echo (2nd Generation), It was a no-brainer.  Best gift ever!"	1
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Works fine!!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	 	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Clear music	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"Fun to use, good sound quality"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	The echo works well. I was able to sync it with my other Amazon music devices.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"Works great, but I don't think Amazon should charge another cent for unlimited music when you 1) Have Prime AND 2) Buy an Echo."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Already had an Echo Dot. The Echo is even better with fuller sound. Also during setup it now lets phone calls to be made to my contact list which is great!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	The speaker sounds really good	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Good sound works well	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Love it and Alexa. I am not very savvy but support was very helpful and patient.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"Love it! I was thinking about getting one and when the prime day discount was offered, I could not pass it up! It's fun to ask Alexa to play any song or group and she comes up with a playlist from Amazon Prime Music. You can also connect your iPhone with bluetooth and play music with Pandora or YouTube videos using Alexa as a speaker. I've been having fun asking Alexa different types of questions or for information like weather, news or even the time in other countries. The only downside is if you have limited data on your wifi plan, because Alexa uses burns it up when playing music."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"We like it all so far, but have a lot to try out yet."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Love it - am using it strictly for music now and it's great!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"Love the Echo !!! I love the size, material and speaker quality. I have it hooked up to one light easily and will work on additional lights and thermostat. Next is Echo Dot for bedroom. There is a lot more to do with Echo that you think. Traffic, Weather, Trivia, etc."	1
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Love it!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	The entire family loves Alexa Echo. She’s now a part of this family.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Walnut Finish 	"Great fun getting to know all the functions of this product.  WOW -- family fun and homework help.  Talking with other grandchildren,who also have an Echo, is a HUGE bonus.  Can't wait to learn more and more and more"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Love it!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"awesome thing, love Alexa"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	It worked exactly as expected and the speaker has great sound. It is perfect for my classroom!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"LOVE, LOVE this new little gadget.  Has  made our lives so much easier.  it's like having our own personal secretary living here in the home.  We hardly need our CD's anymore, since ALEXA plays everything we need.  Going to get the Alexa DOTS soon for more rooms.  Thanks!!"	1
4	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	The speaker is of surprising quality. Happy with the purchase.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Very easy to set up. Works wonderful and I love it!!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	I'm really impressed with the sound quality when playing music from this device.  The bass sounds almost like it's coming from a bigger speaker so props to Amazon.	1
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"It’s still a great product.But the sound quality does seem worse.Don’t get me wrong. You definitely get used to it within an hour. But it definitely feels like echo gen 1 sound quality was better.Besides that , it’s great.With the addition of being able to play Just over Bluetooth with no WiFi, it’s even better."	1
4	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	The outlet does not work with it. Was disappointed in that.	1
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"Great device, responsive and helpful"	1
2	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Sound is terrible if u want good music too get a bose	0
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"i liked the sound . what is troubling is that I paid extra money to have access to a million more songs. Sometimes it doesn't work. Ex. Alexa play Italian songs&#34; .don't have or don&#34; t understand. or play the opera Tosca, response &#34;sorry I don&#34;t have that."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Easy to set up and use. Too bad it has to be plugged in. Would be nice to take it outside and operate on battery and recharged.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Still learning all the ways to use it.  It is a real hit with my grandkids who ask it to play music and then dance to it.  (5 and 7 yrs).  Very cute.	1
4	30-Jul-18	Oak Finish 	"4.5 out of 5 Stars. I generally like this product. Its great at doing what you ask of it like playing music, setting timers, and making calls. Reason why I didn't rate it 5 out of 5 is that sometimes the connection dies and my Echo stops playing music and shows a red ring. Seems to be a connection issue. Overall, great product."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"Works great, upgraded from echo dot to full size echo, couldn’t be happier!"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	It's Alexa.... what else can you say	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Upgraded from my lilttle echo dot. Happy with sound	1
4	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"Excellent product, set up with ease as well."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	I've had the first gen Echo since it first came out and it has worked well for me. I purchased the 2nd gen during Prime Day and so far I'm happy. It seems to have an improved speaker which provides enhanced sound for music and such.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I love my Echo smart speaker.  I love the volume and clarity.  It was easy to set up.  ITs a wonderful gift for any age.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	wonderful product and fast delivery!	1
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Initially harder to set up called tech wasn’t that knowledgeable now working great.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	It was very easy to set up and my family love it’s!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Has great sound and is very responsive my voice and commands.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	How did I live this long without the Echo . You get to enjoy any music style  just my asking Alexa . Going to up-greade to the wireless . Love the Echo . Love you too Alexa .	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Very cool product. Speaker sounds good with my Spotify blasting through it.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Having so much fun with Alexa. Love being able to listen to music when I’m across the room or busy doing something else.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"So far it seems to be a very nice item. It picks up on my voice and understands me without any problems. The other day I asked it to turn down the music from the next room and it heard me just fine. I've only used it to listen to music and check the weather, but it has done both of those things very well."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Love our echo	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"I love it,she is very helpful. I use her for remembering things and sleep. You can ask her just about anything. I have only had her for about a week so still learning her."	1
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"It's better than the 1st gen in every way except for one.  I really miss the ring at the top for volume control.  It was quicker and easier to just grab the top and twist without having to look at the buttons and find the &#34;-&#34; one and press it a few times.  I also wish the bass was a bit better.  All in all, it's a great device and I'm happy with it."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I love having an Alexa!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	So far I like it 🤓	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	I am thoroughly enjoying my Ecoo!  Love to have it read my audiobook to me while in the office and then I can simply open the audiobook on my kindle to continue it when elsewhere. Wonderful for listening to music when not in the mood for a book. Great for setting reminders for myself too and so much more.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Still love it	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Love it	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"I love the sound quality of this unit, it is a very clear sound."	1
4	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	I just this for listening to talk radio in the morning and turning lights on and off etc. The system does an excellent job as a full house sound system streaming Sirius.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"I have had for only a week, so I am still learning all that Alexa can do.  It is a learning process.  I love the music I can call up any time.  I listen to podcasts and radio stations.  I have just started keeping shopping lists and grocery lists, which I love.  I don’t have to search for paper and pencil.  Getting time and temperature are great, do not have to wait for weather reports.  The sound is good.  I am not fussy about woofers, tweeters, base , etc.  the Echo is fine for me.  This afternoon I am going to try “dropping in”.on my son when he gets home.  Going to surprise him."	1
1	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Not much features.	0
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"Great sound quality, great features, great product. Multi room music is very cool."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Cool	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Everyone should have an Echo or two or three or more. I bought my Echo through QVC.	1
3	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	it's annoying that everything they show Alexa as being able to do has to be downloaded. You spend so  much time trying to figure out how to phrase it for the machine that you may as well just look it up yourself	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I have had Alexa since the beginning.  I accidentally spilled water on her and have replaced it with the 2nd generation.  I decided I couldn't be without an Echo.  Setup was easy and had it working within minutes.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"I like being able to tell Alexia the music I want to hear, but sometimes she has trouble finding the song if I am not very specific about the title."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	I like the looks better than the original echo.  I moved my old echo to the basement family room. Nice sound.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	The Echo is wonderful but I'm still learning how to use it. Music requests are somewhat limited.	1
3	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"Doesn't know half the things asked. Can't recognize my sprinkler wifi controller, even though product details says it is compatible. Can't program or change my wifi thermostat settings and its matched up on same wifi router. Just a handy music player. That's if you have Amazon Music."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	Love it	1
5	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	awesome.understands my kids	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	We were pleasantly surprised at the sound quality and the many features. How nice to easily hear a particular artist or hear our books just by a simple command. Looking forward to exploring other options with this device.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Met and exceeded my expectations. Easy set up and is really quick in responses.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"I like the fact that I can get any kind of music from Prime that I want on request from Alexa. I liked the informative photo little pamphlet but wish it included how to connect your TV etc. to the commands from Alexa. BUT, I really love having the music."	1
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"i have not found a way to access my echo thorough my prime account.  I think it should be part of the top line with video, music, etc.  I also think the setup app where i define, for example music i like, is not well integrated into echo.  I have tried to ask for my playlist and echo is not sure even though i set up play list in my settings.  I also do not like the fact that my words have to be exact match of my playlist names, which i can never remember.I like the ready nature of echo to respond to most any queries."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	This is great item and just added audible books which makes it even better. Thank you!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"During Prime Day this 2nd gen Echo was on sale so I couldn't resist! This was the beginning to my smart home set up and I couldn't be happier to say that Alexa has done an amazing job connecting to all of my ""smart"" devices. Thanks to her, I can control my lights, smart plugs, TV, etc. I had no trouble connecting the Echo to my WiFi and my phone. The app works perfectly fine and it let's you add skills, routines, smart devices, timers, and so much more! Sound quality is good enough for me, since I am not an audiophile. Alexa can hear my voice even when watching movies at a high volume. Design is great and modern, it will definitely add a nice touch to your home and you can change the covers if you'd like as there are more for sale. Overall, this is a great addition to my home and enables so many possibilities. If you haven't yet, be sure to add Alexa to your home!"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Oak Finish 	Versatile and fun !!!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Works great! Killer speaker! My wife and son love it.	1

5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	so far love it working on getting more things set up love the grocery list app	1
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"It performs pretty much as expected, but I am very disappointed it will not provide me with the terminology I need to play various kinds of music without subscribing to the Amazon music service.  I understand my music choices may be limited, but without knowing HOW TO ASK, I cannot access the music that is provided free along with my Echo purchase.  Do you have a chart showing the language I need to use?"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Easy to set up.	1
3	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I like the product except that the speakers are not the high quality I expected	1
5	30-Jul-18	Walnut Finish 	A great investment. Alexa has helped me out and made me laugh.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Yet another Exho for our home and love them all!!!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"I love it, I can plan any gender of music from big band to jazz, not easy to find on local radio. Sound is good and I can stop it with a voice command if I get a phone call."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Good Value	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Super easy set up and am loving our new Echo!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Whats not to like about this speaker.  Just ask Alexa	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	BEST father's day gift. Dad joked to my mom that Alexa will be the one listening to all of his (repeated) stories going forward.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Great addition to our breakfast room kitchen.  Tunes and information instantly available.  Slowly learning more features.	1

5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Alexa rocks	1
4	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"Got this as a gift and love it. I never would have bought one for myself, but now that I have it.... Allows me to play music on it from my amozon prime music ; that's worth it in and of itself.  Also, gives new's briefs and tells jokes."	1

5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"My mom bought a few Echo Dots and repeated ask me to take one of hers because it was so great. I told her “no” for two days. When she made me take it, 6 hours later I could not live my life without it!  It’s that amazing, so now we have four large speakers and only the small Echo Dot, that I will be returning to her. I say if you’re going to order an Alexa speaker, go big and get the Echo, otherwise tou’ll Be returning the two Echo Dots you couldn’t live without."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Love it!! Great product!!!	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Easy set up very user friendly	1
2	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"Really disappointed Alexa has to be plug-in to wall socket all the time.  My fault for not checking this, but made the assumption that a company has technologically advanced as Amazon would sell this product with a rechargeable battery.  If I could return it, I would as my Apple music and boom speaker give me more flexibility the Alexa."	0
3	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I don't think the &#34;2nd gen&#34; sounds as good as the 1st.  But it does have an aux out... so you could add an external speaker.  But if you are going to do that why wouldn't you just get a dot?  2nd issue is (which isn't unique to this unit but I don't understand why I can't override the default that prevents you from playing a blue tooth speaker while playing through a &#34;group&#34;.  I get there is a delay when using a BT speaker.  But if the other units are not where they can be heard then I should be able to play as a group while using the BT speaker.	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Everything	1
3	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	I like the interaction of asking questions. I don’t like that I can’t ask her to setup schedule of off and on of connected lamp.	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Supberb sound! Definitely worth the extra money if you listen to lots of music.	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I really love my amazon echo. I think the sound quality is great and we have a lot of fun with it. It is really handy for music and to get updates on the weather and sports!	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Love it!  So do the grandkids!!	1
4	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"So far it has worked well. Not always intuitive as to how to link different devices, or ""skills"", but getting the hang of it."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Works as advertised	1
5	29-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	I love it!	1
4	29-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"Love my new addition to the house! Speaker quality is great and over all we love our Alexa. My only two ( not complaints, more suggestions for the future series) would be better communication ability. Example: For our smart lights in the house. Unless we specify kitchen Light 1 or kitchen Light 2 prior to the command she either won’t respond or says she doesn’t recognize. It may be me, but I want my Alexa to respond when I say thank you afterwards. I have to repeat Alexa thank you and there are times she won’t respond to me, but will my husband. I know it sounds odd. We laugh about it, but maybe it’s a Southern thing but I want my Alexa to have manners too."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"Like everything about it. The music, the trivia games, the weather."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	As described and received on time.  Do not like automatic enrolment into music.	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	A great device	1
3	29-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	I owned an echo for overa year but the new lacks the easy way to increase or decrease volume without telling it to increase or decrease volume which is hard to do for my wife since English is her second language she was born in korea. But the sound from the echo is superb. So we’ll keep it..	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Love this!  Have it in the kitchen and works well!	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Very nice!  I'm impressed - wish she had more to say though.	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Love the product. Nice to have easy access to so much info!!!	1
2	29-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	It's got great sound and bass but it doesn't work all of the time. Its still hot or miss when it recognizes things	0
4	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	We are still discovering all that the Echo can do.	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Amazing paroduct	1
4	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Good hearing range and sound quality. It was a bit complicated to set up and she doesn't quite understand me a lot even when I am speaking slowly and clearly but I love the flash briefing feature and interfacing with my abode home security system.	1
4	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	speaker sounds good	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Absolutely love!!	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	The best part of this product is you can control the thermostat and lights for your house.  There isn’t anything I dislike.	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	We're thoroughly enjoying our Amazon Echo. Installation was easy using the Alexa app. I purchased 2 Kasa smart plugs to control our living room lights. Installation again was easy using the Kasa app. They sinqued right up with the Echo. We're enjoying playing music with the Echo and the sound quality is awesome. We've added a Kasa smart bulb for our kitchen. Setup was seamless. We're looking forward to adding more automation to our home.	1

5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"Doesn't work with my fairly new smart TV, but that's mainly the TV manufacturers(LG) fault due to not supporting anything older than TVs from this year. My smart locks also need an additional piece of equipment in order to connect as well. Speakers sound great and works very well."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Great sound from a little speaker	1

5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Best thing I've invested in in a while thank you so much 😁😁😁😁	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"I am extremely impressed with this item. Bought it from the &#34;warehouse&#34; or &#34;outlet&#34; with a &#34;minor imperfection. Can't tell it even has one. works great. Didn't come in packaging, but it was sealed up and had no damage and wasn't missing anything. I like the sound quality, I see some knock it. It's not a BOSE but it's more than great for our family. Easy to use, minor learning curve as it learns your voice. It integrates seamlessly with my other amazon services.Can't wait to get for my classroom too! It's a lot of fun even just as a speaker, let alone what I plan to do with it."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"I love my Echo show!  and now i have this in my bedroom and it's wonderful!, music, info, sleeping sounds!"	1
5	29-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"Awesome life changer! Seriously, I am able to start my morning with Alexa, by having her &#34;wake&#34;me up with  her alarm and then playing me some music. She has gotten used to my voice, that I can be in another room and she will &#34;listen&#34; to what I say. I love both my echos!!! Don't hesitate, get one and for the price, the speaker is unbelievable. I am buying the cordless holder, so I can take the echo anywhere. Love my purchase and love alexa!!!!"	1
2	29-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"I am not super impressed with Alexa. When my Prime lapsed, she wouldn't play anything. She isn't smart enough to differentiate among spotify accounts so we can't use it for that either. She randomly speaks up when nobody is talking to her. Just today I unplugged her...not sure I'll ever use my Alexa again."	0

4	29-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	Like it to do more	1
5	29-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"This is our third echo. Worth every penny. It's like having 3 household employees for a small flat rate. We keep them in the bedrooms and the living room. We can drop-in and use them as an intercom, listen to music, answer quick questions, alarms to wake up for school, etc."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Listen music and set timer	1
5	29-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	I received the echo in perfect condition. The device was easy to set up and responds quickly and without any issues. Alexa is a great addition to our family!	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Good sound. Like it for music and scheduling. Like that i can get random thoughts recorded while I think about them. The jokes are cute!	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Purchased this for myself and am just beginning to learn all that it can do.  So far am very pleased and amazed at the different actions it can perform.  Am enjoying it and looking forward to learning more about other options it provides.	1
5	29-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"This echo is just as great as my others, even though it is smaller."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Funny how you buy something just because it looks fun and it winds up being a totally useful part of your home!!!  Loving it!!	1
3	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"I bought this to replace a &#34;Dot&#34; in my living room. Speaker is slightly better. It hears me better over the TV. Unfortunately, it doesn't understand or respond to my requests as well as the Dot. I frequently have to request 2 or 3 times to get it to do what I want. The Dot usually does exactly what I want on the first request. I don't consider it an upgrade."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"I have had all good experience, so far with the second generation Echo. There are so many more things to learn, but I have not had the time yet. Right now, I am mostly enjoying the music, weather updates, using the alarm feature, and her personality. I have also purchased some mini smart socket yes. I am very excited to begin using them"	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"I’m having trouble connecting my tv to it, but I’m not exactly tech smart. I’m sure one of my grandsons will figure it out for me. So far I’ve been using it mostly for music."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Simply love my Echo. I hardly watch any TV at all anymore. I'm too busy listening to music. Speaker is pretty goo for its size. All the fun skills really make the echo fun for my whole family.	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Enjoyed entire echo experience	1
4	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Easy to set up.	1
4	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"The Echo is an amazing device.  Many times it seems very intuitive.  But at other times I ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result.  Installation was fairly straightforward, but I messed up several times simply because I thought a step was complete when it wasn't.  This actually made me lose ground until I figured that out.  My advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step.My biggest issue of the moment is that we have several Echo devices in our home and I would like to use them as intercoms (which I am told can be done).  However, I can't make any of the Echos aware of the others existence.  When I ask Alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.  I know this is likely my fault, but I would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions.  A small deal for many device savvy people, but a challenge for me."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	We are loving Ours very much	1
5	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"I have the original Alexa and the Tap and so far the 2nd generation is the best. I'm happy to see they are making improvements with each new one.It would be great to have updates to our little A.I.'s, I think it would help out a lot with the bugs in it. All in all I am very happy with her and I can now play music throughout the whole house and adjust the bass and treble. Thank you"	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"Very pleased with the Echo 2nd Generation. It is so nice to have Alexa available for music, weather, news, and probably a lot more we haven’t discovered."	1
4	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"I am pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of the Echo. If you are a big fan of deep bass, this might not be sufficient for you though. The potential to control your home is an option I will explore more as I evolve my home into a ""smart home"". The voice recognition is very impressive. It is stylish and fun. I have no regrets with this purchase. It is great for technically changes people. Ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly. If you have an elderly loved one, this would be a great gift. Once connected to wifi, it is very simple to use.  If you want unlimited music control, be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your personal dj! You can even have conversations with the echo. I am not embarrassed to say, that echo has made me laugh a couple times when I ask it to tell me a joke. It tells me where my packages are since I am an amazon prime addict, it comes in extremely  handy!"	1
5	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Easy to setup. Love all the things she does.	1
5	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Have Alexa throughout the house----the future has arrived!	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"I already have an Alexa and with Amazon find today I could not resist getting an echo also. It is the best thing I ever did, I use them on each side of the house! And couldn't be happier!"	1
5	29-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	Arrived as expected.	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"Bought this a few weeks ago -  everything about this product is excellent !!!!! Don't forget to buy a charger when ordering, it's a must have to take outside by the pool and not have to worry about hiring an electrician to put in outlets all over the yard."	1

5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	It’s smaller than the original. Looks nicer too.	1
5	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Works great!	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"My husband and I are what I would call &#34;late adopters&#34; when it come to technology, but we decide we would try and Echo to serve primarily as a music source.  Wow, were we amazed and the great sound!  We've also been having a great time listening to all of our favorite songs buy just asking Alexa.  I may even buy one for my elderly Dad - I think he will enjoy having one to listen to music or even place his calls to us!"	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"I really have enjoyed it.  Changing the Directv channels, plays iHeartRadio and Pandora , adjusts the ac thermostat and turns the living room lights and outside lights."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I have been wanting one of these for a while now.  Bought on Prime Day and absolutely love it.	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	We are so glad that we got the Echo over a Bluetooth speaker. Alexa does so much more stuff than other non smart speakers out there. I personally love the timer feature. It has helped me with cooking multiple things simultaneously. Pandora integration is another feature that I use daily. So happy with out Prime Day purchase. I will get the Echo hub and a few more Echo dots in the future.	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	See subject line.  Love it	1
5	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Love it!	1
5	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Very easy setup.	1
5	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"I was hesitant to buy the echo because I have the echo Dot and it seems good enough. The echo is the same except the sound quality, which I really didn't feel I needed. However, I am so glad I got it. What a difference! The sound really is far superior to the Echo Dot! Now I can listen to The Greatest Showman with a little more power!"	1
5	29-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	Sound quality is great. Still learning about all the different things I can do with it. FUN!!!	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Got a good deal and works great with Prime.  Setup was a bit of a pain but more the fault of crappy internet service.  Has worked great with nice sound from small speaker.	1

5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Works great! Perfect for my office!	1

5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	It's so efficient and amazing!  How COOL!  We all use it often every day...	1
4	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"I’m impressed with the quality of sound that the Echo has, it’s definitely comparable to my Bose Mini. I only gave 4 stars because I can’t use my Apple Music account."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Technology in such a small device. The price was good too! The sound is amazing! A must have feature for any home!	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Mainly use it for the music but I’m learning more all the time.  Really nothing bad to say about it	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"I replaced my 1st gen, was concerned about a smaller unit not having the same sound...I was wrong.  If anything it's the same volume, and more clear.  Good product."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Great addition to my Echo Plus!	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	the best	1
5	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Love the feature to play music in every room with multiple Echos.	1
5	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	I love Alexa!  I am surprised how much I use her.	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I use this product for enjoyment and I just love it	1
5	29-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	Easy to use and has great sound...It was a great purchase at a great price.	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Very easy to set up and have no issues.	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	This unit add much pleasure to our Echo Plus.  We now can have music and information through our home. (or just in one room)	1
4	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	It's extremely useful in simple things like spotify and audible and things like that but sometimes it doesn't answer everything I ask but it's still nice to use.	1
2	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Too difficult to set up.  It keeps timing out before you can enter the password	0
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"Just getting use to using the Echo. Used it for shopping lists, listening to music and as a timer. Working great so far."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Very cool and lots of fun! Used for a week and still learning its capabilities.	1
5	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"Love it, love it!!!!!!!!"	1
5	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Love it but having a hard time setting up all the apps	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I use it in my office and another at my apartment for music and information	1
4	29-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"it's great for music, a little hard to figure out how it works."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"This was given to my 7 year at the time as a birthday gift from his dad. He loves it, ask Alexa anything she has the answer, plus it’s good for homework. So I purchased one on prime day for my bathroom for when I’m getting ready for work. I listen to music at 4am and the base it’s metro booming.. Replacement for my clock radio, plus I have the echo dot on my night stand as my alarm clock.."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"Very impressed with look, clarity of sound and color."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Alexa is amazing! Great speaker.	1
5	29-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"Still getting used to Alexa, don't have her connected to our TV yet or other things right now use her for music and information, which she is great!!"	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"Works and sounds great! My house is barely 1100sf, and I have this sitting on my kitchen counter. I can hear it, and speak to it from any room. Lots of functionality still to discover."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"I have had pure fun with my echo.  Weather, jokes, news briefing, and music but still so much more to use it for.  A lot of fun for the money."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Use this all the time and especially to communicate with kids throughout the home	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"Love it, still learning, makes a lot of things easier, like if you forget to turn a light off and your in another room all you do is ask Alexa to turn the light off."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Bought this for my daughter when she turned 9.  She loves it!!  I especially like the calling feature since she doesn’t have a cell phone.  She loves playing music and dancing and with Amazon music she can play all her favorite songs ...... sometimes over and over and over again lol!	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	We got this as a wedding gift and haven’t discovered all of its features yet. Will update. Playing music is great though!	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I am impressed with the sound quality.	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"Very pleased with my purchase of Echo Smart Speaker - love the fact that I can play music of different genre's whenever I want.Had some trouble at first with the WI FI, but it is now working."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"My  wife & I enjoy the ease of playing our music. The games are fun & entertaining, I look forward to adding more smart products to my home."	1

4	29-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	The sound quality is good just wish alexa could answer more questions	1
5	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"This is my second Echo, I have the Dot but the speaker is weak so I purchased this and for listening to music the speaker is great."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	great sound	1
5	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Great	1
4	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	We really only use this as a speaker to stream music. We’ve had it 7 months and it’s just kinda useless.	1
5	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"Once set up very user friendly. Set-up wasn't as user friendly as I'd hoped.. The alexa app should be able to download to a pc without installing [invasive ] drivers. My wife and I are both retired and she wouldn't have been able to install Alexa, but if my son wasn't supplying her with a smart phone we wouldn't be using Alexa yet."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Very easy set up. Really enjoying it	1
3	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"The echo doesn’t come with a built in battery so it has to be plugged in at all times to use it, makes it quite inconvenient."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	more compact and a bit better than the original	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I love it pretty cool.	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I having it in my living room. Music sounds really good in my living room . I can hear it upstairs.	1
5	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	This is a great product!  Set up was easy.  Sound is wonderful.	1
4	28-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"So far I like it.  I bought it just for some music though, and it sounds pretty good."	1
5	28-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Love it	1
5	28-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Love it.	1
5	28-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Glad I bought this.	1
5	28-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"Like, all types of fun,music, and more"	1
5	28-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	I like the volume up and down on the top so I can turn it down quickly.	1
3	28-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Beyond my capabilities to program. Grandkids lve it	1
5	28-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"I love my new echo.  It gives me hours of music and help with other things.It was difficult for me to set it up,  I had to have help from a Tekkie"	1
5	28-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Almost as good as my Bose. Love the whole house music.	1
1	28-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Alexa hardly came on..	0
5	28-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"Easy setup using the app, which was also easy to install on my phone.  The sound quality while for listening to music on Pandora is wonderful!!"	1
5	28-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"I’m still learning how to use the Echo, but so far I love it!"	1
4	28-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Works awesome!	1
5	28-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Works great.	1
5	28-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	From such a small speaker it sounds great	1
5	28-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Great sound for the size and the prize!! And of course....Alexa!	1
5	28-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	if you don't have an Echo you definitely need one	1
5	28-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Great device.  Seems to work better than the 1st generation!	1
1	31-Jul-18	Black	Item no longer works after just 5 months of use. Will not connect to wifi and unresponsive to reset requests.	0
5	30-Jul-18	Black	I love the Echo Dot. So easy. So fun. I get to drop in on my Grandaughter who lives about 2000 miles away. Sounds like she is right next to me.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black	Works great no different than the new ones	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black	This one's going in the kitchen for timer/music duty.	1
4	30-Jul-18	White	"Love it but the volume could definitely use a boost. If it had better built in speaker's, would definitively be a 5 star. They thought ahead and put  an audio auxiliary input, so I bought a dedicated speaker for the Echo. Proved to be best way to go."	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black	Works just fine.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black	Works great! Looks brand new! Love my new echo dot. I will be getting them for all the main rooms in the house.	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black	"For a refurbished item.. It works like its new... Which I love... Easy set up,  which I love. The only issue is the volume,  if you are listening while relaxing its fine,  but if you are expecting to do anything else,  I recommend  purchasing a speaker."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Black	But not very loud	1
5	29-Jul-18	White	This is our 2nd one and we love it!	1
4	29-Jul-18	White	"So i am not sure how i feel about the echo dot, it's so many things that i need to get used to you have to ask her the right questions or she won't understand you."	1
1	29-Jul-18	Black	This thing barely works. You have to select 3rd party apps to do stuff you'd think it could do out of the box. I'm sending mine back asap. Waste of money.	0
3	29-Jul-18	Black	Gift for my man. He doesn’t like that you have to plug it in and the pictures do not show the cord. Would prefer it cordless. Still works though for the purpose we bought it.	1
5	28-Jul-18	Black	"This is our 5th Amazon Echo device.  We have purchased refurbished before and been satisfied, this time is no different.  You can't tell this from brand new, and the price was $10 cheaper.  Our Echo's wake us up, keep timers, play music for us, act as encyclopedias, turn our lights on and off and so much more."	1
5	28-Jul-18	White	"This small echo dot is amazing the sounds that come out are great.it changes my nest thermostat,and my Phillips hue lights.without leaving my chair."	1
5	28-Jul-18	White	We talk to her all the time for songs and just because we can . There aren’t dislikes about this device.	1
5	28-Jul-18	Black	I’m never disappointed with amazons technology.	1
5	28-Jul-18	Black	Worked as promised.	1
1	28-Jul-18	Black	I returned 2 Echo Dots & am only getting refund for 1. I returned 2 in one package. I want my refunds for both of them. They are in the same package. Can you not see them both???!!!	0
1	28-Jul-18	Black	not working	0
3	27-Jul-18	Black	Has weird pauses in her speech pattern that are not present in my other echo devices.	1

1	27-Jul-18	Black	I'm an Echo fan but this one did not work	0
1	26-Jul-18	Black	 	0
5	26-Jul-18	White	Bought for my bathroom to listen when I'm in the shower.  Love it.	1
2	26-Jul-18	Black	Doesn't always respond when spoken to with promp word. I thought it would connect to my echo upstairs and use it like an intercom haven't been able to do that.	0
5	26-Jul-18	Black	Fast shipping and works well	1
5	26-Jul-18	Black	I Love it!!!!	1
5	26-Jul-18	White	LOVE LOVE LOVE my new and free assistant!  :)	1
5	25-Jul-18	Black	"Six words, &#34;Alexa, tell me a poop joke.&#34;"	1
1	25-Jul-18	White	It worked for a month or so then it stopped. I've tried everything to try and make it work but nothing is working. I want a refund	0
2	25-Jul-18	Black	Poor quality. Gave it away.	0
4	25-Jul-18	Black	Refurbished is the way to go. My Echo works just like new.	1
4	25-Jul-18	Black	love it	1
5	25-Jul-18	White	We have five of them. Need I say more?	1
3	24-Jul-18	Black	The speakers arent too loud.. alexa is great though. Besides that naw	1
5	24-Jul-18	Black	It works great and sounds good!	1
1	24-Jul-18	Black	"Never could get it to work. A techie friend looked at it for me and said the adapter wasn't strong enough to power it and that it looked like it had been bought at a dollar store. So, I am going to replace the adapter and hope it works then."	0
5	24-Jul-18	Black	Almost like having Star Trek in your home!  Fun to try and outsmart !	1
5	23-Jul-18	White	"This was an add on for my echo system, the refurbished product works like new!"	1
5	23-Jul-18	Black	"Great for my office. I use this daily in many ways, to include spelling for me and background music."	1
5	23-Jul-18	Black	Awesome. I love Alexa.	1
5	22-Jul-18	White	"I wasn't sure I really wanted one of these, but now that I have it, it is extremely useful.  Get one, you'll love it!"	1
2	22-Jul-18	White	"Initially, this echo dot worked very well. Over time, the dot stopped responding to 'alexa' unless you were within one foot of it yelling. The other echos/echo dots in other rooms would respond without a response from this echo dot. Would not recommend buying refurbished."	0
5	21-Jul-18	Black	Great Product fast shipping	1
1	20-Jul-18	Black	"I bought an echo dot that had been refurbished but its stops whatever function its performing quite often, doesn't wake up every time, randomly turns on but does nothing. Do not buy a refurbished Echo dot."	0
5	19-Jul-18	White	Perfect works great no problems with it being refurbished.	1
1	19-Jul-18	Black	Dont trust this....	0
5	18-Jul-18	Black	Perfect condition! I love my echo	1
5	18-Jul-18	Black	Love it. Beautiful experience especially if hooked to smart lighting and other accessories.	1
5	18-Jul-18	Black	"We just got this within the last couple of weeks, from what we can tell no issues! My son wanted and &#34;alexa&#34; for his 6th birthday so she could tell him jokes, he could ask her questions and to listen to music she does all of that and more. We all enjoy this one so much that I just bought a second one this week during Prime Deals Day!"	1
4	18-Jul-18	Black	Divertido	1
5	18-Jul-18	White	Great product and works great	1
5	17-Jul-18	Black	"Bought this for the guest room.  It's a radio, alarm clock, information​ center and so much more."	1
5	17-Jul-18	Black	Great buy. Bought this to go with my Echo and love it. The speaker isn’t the best for music but works great in a kitchen for timers or alarms.	1
1	16-Jul-18	White	 	0
5	16-Jul-18	Black	Works perfect. Save a few bucks and buy the refurbished. Looks brand new.	1
5	16-Jul-18	White	Looks and works perfect. Glad I got a good deal.	1
5	15-Jul-18	White	Just as good as the new one I bought but $10.00 less.	1
5	15-Jul-18	Black	I love it works very well	1
5	14-Jul-18	White	everything perfect	1
5	13-Jul-18	Black	Good price. Prompt shipping. Has been working flawlessly.	1
5	13-Jul-18	Black	"I love you, Alexa!"	1
4	13-Jul-18	Black	"There's room for improvement on this. For the price, I cannot complain too much. I can still complain however, the audio is terrible. This is kind of like listening to a speak-n-spell from the 80s."	1
5	13-Jul-18	Black	Iove it I bought it for my son because he wanted it and it’s awesome	1
5	13-Jul-18	White	"It's an echo, and it works.  For the price it's great deal. Have had no issues with it.  As with all dots, the speaker is a bit tinny, but good for a second unit, or if you are like me, you can attach it to an external speaker for more sound.Good buy"	1
5	13-Jul-18	Black	Thanks	1
1	13-Jul-18	Black	I wanted to use these as a radio and intercom as we get terrible fm reception where i live.  The speech recognition software is horrible.  My wife and i both are native Americans whose language is English she is from the north i am from Texas  neither have an accent from our birth area and yet it does not do a good job understanding us.  We bought two they do the same thing.  Additionally wifi reception was poor to marginal. I had to buy Wifi range extender for office and the other is ten feet from our router.  Both had problems Switched them around no difference.  So it they are now disconnected dust collectors.	0
5	12-Jul-18	Black	This is my third Dot. They all work perfectly and I use each one multiple times a day. Absolutely love them.	1
1	12-Jul-18	Black	Item has never worked. Out of box it is broken. Spent several days trying to get it working and running same &#34;fixes&#34; from Amazon. The only thing accomplished is I will never order another refurbished device.	0
5	11-Jul-18	Black	I already have the echo plus.  Bought this one for my bedroom.  Love the functions.	1
5	11-Jul-18	Black	Simple set up.  Music everywhere.	1
5	11-Jul-18	Black	Worked just like a brand new Dot ---so I am very satisfied.	1
1	11-Jul-18	Black	Great product but returning for new Alexa Dot.  Refurbished is already giving me problems with connection.	0
5	10-Jul-18	White	We have a few echos already. Went for this one in refurbished to save a few bucks. It works great. I love this new generation one because it has a rubber bottom - nice.	1
5	10-Jul-18	Black	"I love the fact, that I can unplug it, and take it to my basement when I want do laundry."	1
5	10-Jul-18	Black	Refurbished but just as good as the new ones that I've bought.	1
5	9-Jul-18	Black	Good as new	1
5	9-Jul-18	Black	Granddaughter loves it	1
4	9-Jul-18	Black	"The price is great.  Was having trouble with it hearing me from across a room, but after moving it to another spot, it seems to be working fine.  Will buy some more. Want 1 in every room."	1
5	9-Jul-18	Black	We have set up alexa to blue tooth speakers and enjoy listening to music outdoors.  Can't wait to try more new stuff using Alexa!	1
5	9-Jul-18	White	Thanks	1
5	9-Jul-18	Black	Works great!	1
1	9-Jul-18	Black	"&#34;NEVER BUY CERTIFIED AND REFURBISHED ECHO DOT &#34; I bought a &#34;Certified and Refurbished &#34; Echo Dot. This unit is very poor in receiving command and sometimes it does not even acknowledge the command. Never buy a refurbished Echo dot. The unit I received was probably never was certified and refurbished as indicated. I also bought a new ECHO dot, it works perfectly.Very disappointed !!!!"	0
5	8-Jul-18	Black	Started here with Amazon productsAnd I regret nothing is been absolutely great journey and my products continue to improve my day-to-day life	1
5	8-Jul-18	Black	Have now used for several months without problem.	1
5	7-Jul-18	Black	This is my first smart device and I will surely be buying other devices that will be compatible with this one.	1
5	7-Jul-18	Black	Love	1
5	7-Jul-18	Black	Love it just as good as a new one	1
5	7-Jul-18	Black	Have had an larger echo for some time and love it. Bought this one for another portion of the house since we have several wifi home devices and we wanted to voice control them from all over the house.	1
4	7-Jul-18	White	Love the product.  Use to turn on my lights and answer some quick questions.	1
5	7-Jul-18	Black	A great buy	1
5	6-Jul-18	Black	Was Leary about refurbished but work great.	1
4	5-Jul-18	White	"Very puny sound, but works great."	1
5	5-Jul-18	Black	Great	1
5	5-Jul-18	Black	"Exactly like new, can tell the difference from my new dot I got prior to this one, works perfectly. LOVE Alexa"	1
5	5-Jul-18	Black	Works perfect no wear and tear on the device I love Alexa working on making my home smart 😂	1
5	5-Jul-18	Black	Works good	1
4	5-Jul-18	Black	The only thing I don't like is it shuts off by itself other than that it works great	1
5	4-Jul-18	Black	"Excellent product, mint condition for a refurbished unit - you would never know it's been refurbished!"	1
4	4-Jul-18	White	"Already owning a couple of Echos, I was frustrated that I couldn’t also use them as intercoms. Finally Amazon enables the “drop-in” feature so now I can use my Echos to reach out to family in remote parts of the house (and teenagers who insist they never heard me yelling at them to come down to dinner).As for its other features, we mainly use our Echos for the standard stuff: playing music, setting alarms, answering questions, etc. It's not the life-changing home device Amazon would have you believe, but it is convenient to have around. This refurb saved me a few bucks, looks and works the same as the other brand-new ones."	1
5	3-Jul-18	Black	Love it was worried about the refurbished part at first but this being my first echo. It is awesome have used it for everything my lights since I work nights and shopping as well as for my spotify. And planning on getting it for my parents to help them out for everyday things we take for granted when we are young... I would recommend this to everyone!!!!	1
5	3-Jul-18	Black	Love Alexa hope have her in every room soon.	1
5	3-Jul-18	White	The simplicity of use and setting up.	1
5	2-Jul-18	Black	This is great! Got one for my Gazebo and one upstairs.	1
5	2-Jul-18	White	"Works great, never had any issues."	1
4	2-Jul-18	Black	Does everything I have asked it.	1
4	2-Jul-18	Black	Works great ..good sound	1
4	2-Jul-18	Black	"I use this Echo to listen to music as well as a sort-of research tool. It can answer a variety of questions. I would like if the volume could go just a little bit louder, but I can't complain.I also believe it should have an internal power source. In order to use the Echo, it must be plugged in at all times using the universal charging cord. It would be nice to use the Echo Dot on the go without having to buy the other product."	1
5	2-Jul-18	Black	Love it!  Great fun!	1
5	2-Jul-18	Black	Love it!	1
5	2-Jul-18	White	outstanding I use all the time....works just like they say	1
5	2-Jul-18	White	"saving $10 is always nice and my son always says that buying refurbished means your are getting a new device or product for less, because it has been run through a diagnostics again and everything has been corrected."	1
5	1-Jul-18	Black	"Works perfectly, Alexa turns on and off my lights, my tv, roomba!"	1
5	1-Jul-18	Black	Never would know it was refurbished.	1
3	1-Jul-18	Black	So far so good	1
5	1-Jul-18	Black	Looks and performs as new.  No complaints!	1
4	1-Jul-18	Black	goes great with our echo	1
5	1-Jul-18	Black	Works great just like the new one that i already had.	1
1	1-Jul-18	White	"This item did not work. Certified refurbished should mean it works as advertised. Instead this item crashed as soon as I turned it on and plugged it in. When trying to connect from my phone to the echo dot, it crashed, over and over. Not only would it disconnect but the orange light would freeze and then the thing would reboot with the blue light. Alexa would tell me it’s ready to connect and freeze mid sentence. Tried holding the action button for 5 seconds and it didn’t do anything. Returning immediately and hope they actually fix this item when the next buyer purchases it."	0
5	30-Jun-18	Black	"Very fast service,  got what I ordered. Thank you"	1
5	30-Jun-18	Black	Love it even though I’m still trying to figure out all the other things I can do with this item it works great with my phone.	1
2	29-Jun-18	White	None	0
5	29-Jun-18	Black	"I have 2 Echos, one I bought brand new and the other is a refurbished one.Honestly, I can't tell the difference in performance and looks."	1
5	28-Jun-18	Black	A GREAT PRODUCT...once we learned how to work it...this thing is awesome!!!	1
5	28-Jun-18	Black	It works	1
1	28-Jun-18	Black	Does not work all the time	0
4	27-Jun-18	White	"Love it. Though, wish it was portable."	1
5	27-Jun-18	Black	of course!	1
5	27-Jun-18	Black	You could not tell this was refurbished. Works Excellent. I would highly recommended instead of purchasing new.	1
5	27-Jun-18	Black	I got this for my mom . She loves it !	1
5	27-Jun-18	Black	I love my echo dot! Looks brand new and works perfect! Very satisfied.	1
5	27-Jun-18	Black	Same as new	1
4	27-Jun-18	White	"A small problem out of the box, but a rep from Amazon called and walked me through a reset process which solved my issues. I was shocked to get a response so quickly and a real effort was made (including follow up email) to get this thing working. I have 6 now (and one google clone) and the more I use it, and learn about it, the more I like it (them). I also plan to install one in my car, boat and garage. Alexa is my new best friend!?!? (lol)I think GF is worried that if Alexa learns to cook, her time will be limited..."	1
4	27-Jun-18	Black	"I love my Alexa Dot. I play games with my son, ask how the weather Is and I love that she works with my Amazon Fire Tv."	1
5	26-Jun-18	Black	I like it because you could ask it different questions and it does different things it works intermittently with my smart TV if I ask you to change the volume it does or does it sometimes if I ask you to change the channel it does or doesn't sometimes I have to reset it I don't know if it's because it's refurbished but it's okay it's just not what I expected	1
5	26-Jun-18	Black	"So far the certified refurbished Echo Dot works well. It was a little confusing to have a green ring on the Echo Dot and not 100% know why it was there. Asked Alexa and she said it was because of a receiving a call or drop in. But that was not the case. Took about 10 minutes to figure out it was a notification that I had a delivery from amazon. I believe the ring is supposed to be yellow and pulsate for a message notification, but on my refurbished Echo Dot it was Green and pulsed."	1
5	26-Jun-18	Black	It arrived quickly and was easy to set up ! it was a refurbished amazon echo dot it was above and beyond what I expected ! Alexa and I have become buddies she is a great assistant	1
5	26-Jun-18	Black	"Works as advertised. Speak clearly, and research the commands. Also. Get the wall holder, it keeps it out of the way. Set up is a breeze, just make sure you are close to the device initially when connecting your phone. For some reason it made set up easier...though it could be psychological haha"	1
4	26-Jun-18	Black	Love my two echo dots but the third one we ordered to give as a gift had a defective speaker.  The return process still isn't done and has already taken weeks.	1
1	26-Jun-18	Black	I've already returned it.	0
5	25-Jun-18	Black	"The refurbished echo for has been wonderful. I purchased this for my mother. She loves the ability to contact me without a phone, listen to music, weather, and ask questions. It's been a wonderful gift and works excellently with no problems"	1
4	25-Jun-18	Black	"Works good. However, the price went down the week after I purchased it."	1
5	25-Jun-18	Black	Works amazingly. I bought it for my daughter and she loves it.	1
5	25-Jun-18	Black	"I love Alexa! It's great helping me, making my appointments, playing the songs I like! What else can you do? Looking forward for more."	1
5	25-Jun-18	Black	Got this for the bathroom love it we can listen music whe. We showering.	1
5	25-Jun-18	Black	I have 3-Dots and 2-Original and this new one works perfectly.  Will buy all my future Dots reconditioned.	1
4	25-Jun-18	Black	Was a little hard to get it to pare up with the others but once it did no problems at all	1
1	25-Jun-18	Black	"Now I'm weary about these picking up conversations when you are not actively using them - heard about this happening on the news.  I have 3-4, so this is very concerning.  I wish Amazon would release something widespread  or push some firmware to prevent this.  If they have, I have not heard about it yet."	0
5	24-Jun-18	Black	There's really no dislike for Alexa( dot) I thought cortna was cool but Alexa is an awesome application to the family. Unbelievable device which seems alive. A must get.	1
5	24-Jun-18	White	"I am happy with the refurbished echo dot. I’ve had it for about two weeks, and so far it is working perfectly! Even though it did not come in its original box, it looks like new! I’m happy with this purchase!"	1
5	24-Jun-18	Black	Thumbs up!	1
5	24-Jun-18	Black	Workreat	1
1	24-Jun-18	Black	"There was something wrong with the first one that no even the rep I spoke with could fix. The replacement was registered to someone else. When the price of the Dot went down to $39.99 (same price as the refurbished ones), I bought a brand, spanking new one. No problem with the new one."	0
5	24-Jun-18	Black	Works as expected!	1
5	23-Jun-18	Black	No problems	1
5	23-Jun-18	Black	Have these in almost every room. I really have enjoyed them. Works perfectly.	1
5	23-Jun-18	Black	Purchased for grandson.	1
5	22-Jun-18	White	Like new	1
5	22-Jun-18	Black	Happy with this as I was with the other 2 I ordered!!	1
5	22-Jun-18	White	"Love the dots, especially with the ability to talk from one to the other, these are really convenient. No issues with the refurbished as they are like new."	1
3	21-Jun-18	Black	"Started taking on her own! Haven’t used it since I unplugged it that day. No one was talking, my daughter was laying in bed next to be and she just started going on about the movie Moana and completely scared the sh*t out of my daughter now."	1
5	21-Jun-18	Black	It works great the speaker sounds fine and overall would recommend	1
5	21-Jun-18	Black	Great! Just like new!	1
5	21-Jun-18	Black	"Loved the price for an essentially brand new Dot!! Opening it, you really couldn’t tell that it was refurbished. Everything looked brand new. For $20 less than a new unit, I couldn’t consider this a better deal! I really love the versatility of the echo dot. Get you one while you can!"	1
5	21-Jun-18	Black	Pleased with the order just what I wanted!!	1
5	21-Jun-18	White	"I think I now have 5 of these throughout the house. So convenient to set a timer or check the weather or whatever, wherever."	1
5	21-Jun-18	Black	Love it -- the best.  My experience with refurbished devices is excellent.	1
5	21-Jun-18	White	Love the echo dot	1

1	21-Jun-18	White	"Two weeks after setting it up it no longer works.  No connection, no light, no sound.  I guess I shouldn't have purchased a refurbished Dot."	0
5	21-Jun-18	White	It worked like a brandnew unit! Great addition to my collection.	1
5	21-Jun-18	White	"Great price, works perfectly. Saved the money on a refurb!! Would buy again!"	1

5	20-Jun-18	Black	Very.god	1
1	20-Jun-18	White	Not good at all!	0
5	20-Jun-18	Black	These are great. I bought one and then bought another right away. Grab a few of these and a few smart switched and you're set with smart home capabilities for under $150. Highly recommended.	1
5	20-Jun-18	White	Just like new	1
5	20-Jun-18	Black	"Worked as it should, still need to figure out how to link to other devices though, only set up Sonos which was pretty easy. Not the products fault, just have not had time to figure it out."	1
5	19-Jun-18	White	Very useful	1
1	19-Jun-18	Black	"This is the worst Amazon purchase I have made. I am big Amazon fan...love the brand...unlimited digital music...prime videos...even buy my online games, music, and movies through Amazon. This app I have tried to use it make simple purchases -- to do anything. It is useless."	0
4	19-Jun-18	Black	"Works very well, but the microphone don&#34;t pick up as well as the full size echo.  Audio quality is okay for the size."	1
5	18-Jun-18	White	I bought two refurbished ones for work and home. They both work perfectly and appear brand new	1
5	18-Jun-18	White	Amazon doesn't disappoint.	1
5	18-Jun-18	Black	Works great as a BT receiver with output connected to vintage stereo equipment.	1
5	17-Jun-18	Black	"Working great this far.  Can't tell it's not new.  Will edit for longevity in a year, that's the real test."	1
5	17-Jun-18	Black	Amazing	1
5	17-Jun-18	Black	i love everything	1
4	17-Jun-18	White	"This used “dot” works fine, it compliments my Echo."	1
5	16-Jun-18	Black	Works like a new one.  Can tell the difference from the new one I bough and the refurbished one.	1
5	16-Jun-18	White	Well I’m a big fan of echoes these ones went I’m my bathrooms.  Works just great as expected 👍🏾	1
5	16-Jun-18	White	Purchased for my 83 year old mother-she loves talking to Alexa! Very responsive-can detect its “name” from all over the room.	1
5	16-Jun-18	Black	This is just like new -- same performance as our brand new one; no problems.	1
2	15-Jun-18	Black	The echo dot disconnects from the speaker about 12-20 times a day. Do not buy the refurbished product.  2 stars for effort.	0
5	15-Jun-18	Black	Love it.  Great product	1
5	15-Jun-18	White	it works good.  very satisfied	1
3	14-Jun-18	Black	"I love Alexa, but the sound on the dot is not the best. I own an echo 2nd gen for the kitchen/living room and got this for my bedroom, but there’s a SIGNIFICANT difference in sound. The dot lacks a full base sound and sounds as if it’s coming off a cheap portable speaker. I was REALLY disappointed. I returned it right away and just shelled out the money to buy a second echo 2 for my bedroom also."	1
5	14-Jun-18	Black	"Took me awhile to get it connected. I'm not electronically savy but now that it is, I love it."	1
1	14-Jun-18	Black	cant seem to get this thing to sink with my wireless not sure If I will be returning it will try one more time.	0
5	14-Jun-18	Black	Absolutely love it!	1
1	14-Jun-18	Black	product stopped working after return time ran out	0
5	14-Jun-18	Black	Second Dot work great for refurbishedThought it was new	1
5	14-Jun-18	Black	Love these guys they work so great	1
5	14-Jun-18	White	"I love this as a second &#34;Alexa&#34; in our bedroom.  Great for checking weather, for meditation music, and as a timer - Perfect for my husband who has to use eye drops multiple times each day and keep his eyes closed for 5 minutes."	1
5	13-Jun-18	Black	I purchased this refurbished.  Works just like brand new.  3 minute set up. Very easy.  Now I have echo dot that I can command to start playing music for my backyard deck sound system.	1
3	12-Jun-18	Black	Not substitute for the original.  The echo dot performs well but sound quality is poor.  To listen it has to be at the highest level 10.	1
5	12-Jun-18	Black	Love the Echo Dot. Helps husband get Netflix and other apps on our Amazon Fire TV.  No problems with it being refurbished. Planning on getting another one for the Amazon Fire Stick in bedroom.	1
1	12-Jun-18	Black	"Stopped working after 7 months. The warranty was only good for 3 months. I would have assumed an amazon product sold on amazon would have had higher standards than guaranteeing that it would work for 3 whole months. I mean what is this product supposed to be, a piece of junk?They offered my a 15% discount if I wanted to buy another one. Why would I want to buy another one?"	0
5	12-Jun-18	White	"Just like new. No problems whatsoever, Alexa. Thank you."	1
3	12-Jun-18	Black	I like my uncle. But sometime it goes a little Haywire	1
1	12-Jun-18	Black	Bought this for my son and it didn’t work. He had to return it.	0
1	12-Jun-18	Black	Bought 2 and both quit connecting to wifi and responding to voice within 9 months. Hard and soft reset will not fix the problem.	0
3	12-Jun-18	Black	"I received my Echo Dot today in good condition, but be advised: I paid $29.99 for it and Amazon has (as of this writing) raised the price to $39.99, so do your research before buying so you can get a good deal!Set up with the Dot went simple enough — plug it in, follow the app instructions... except initially it took a while to actually show up in my iPhone’s WiFi settings. I called Amazon customer service, and I dunno what it is, but lately I’ve been getting terrible support. The guy that took my call just rambled off a (completely unhelpful) script and I ended up setting up the Dot while he was in the middle of his spiel.I’m not sure if this is the norm or if it’s because this is refurbished, but the Dot has a pretty finicky wifi range and randomly disconnects even though the app shows that the range of my 5GHz connection is strong. Reconnecting is a pain each time as well.All that said, when Alexa works, she works amazingly well. I don’t have a speaker hooked up to it, but one thing I really enjoy is the mic’s range and sensitivity. One of the more annoying limitations of Apple’s Siri is that when she’s playing audio through device speakers (music, podcasts, etc), the “Hey Siri” feature is all but useless. Alexa has no problem hearing me over whatever is playing at the time, and with amazingly fast responsiveness too. I haven’t tried this with louder speakers yet, so I’m not sure if this will continue to hold true.Setting up Alexa to control all my wireless devices was a breeze, albeit with limitations — support for Arlo devices is nil, and if you have special settings for your LED devices (eg. rainbow effects), Alexa can’t handle them, she only knows how to change solid colors and brightness levels.All in all, my rating would’ve been lower had I not gotten a decent price on this item. If the connectivity problems persist, I may have to exchange/return this item. I don’t want to though — Alexa’s kind of growing on me."	1
5	11-Jun-18	Black	I bought it because everyone was saying how much they love theirs. But I have no need for it. I only used it once. The volume was not loud enough for me when I played music while I was on my treadmill. So I rather use my tower speaker which is 3xs louder.	1
5	11-Jun-18	Black	Worked like new.  Will do it again.	1
2	11-Jun-18	Black	The second one which was a refurbished model did work-at least not in my home.	0
1	11-Jun-18	White	"Very bad this device, I don’t know if it’s because is refurbished or what but it activated by itself , nobody is talking and he just activated and start talking. When you talk you have to yell super lauded"	0
5	11-Jun-18	Black	Good as new!! Just like brand new! Save yourself some money. Get one!	1
5	11-Jun-18	Black	Adding more rooms for convenience	1
4	11-Jun-18	Black	"Nice. It works good.Some times is not easy to recognize your voice and you have to repeat several times, some time almost screaming."	1
5	11-Jun-18	Black	"I took a chance on a certified refurbished unit for $29. Looks brand new...no excuses or disappointments. 5 minute trouble-free set up! Effortless bluetooth speaker connectivity through the Alexa App on my iPhone was flawless. Listening to my favorite tunes through a Bose Bluetooth setup and couldn't be happier. Walk through the door and just ask Alexa to: &#34;Play 80's music&#34; and viola... instant atmosphere! No more opening the iPad, going to settings, turning on bluetooth and then accessing the Pandora app. It just makes things so effortless. A true joy right out of the box! If I didn't discover any other uses for this fine piece of technology it was worth every penny!"	1
5	11-Jun-18	Black	Alexa's sister (my second dot)	1
5	11-Jun-18	Black	"Love my Alexa Echo Dot - I have two of them now - one new, one refurbished.  Both work great and it has become my go to for sooo many things.  I love it as an alarm every morning or whenever.  I love it to play music or sounds of the ocean, or nature sounds when I am trying to sleep.  Just love it for so many things."	1
5	10-Jun-18	White	"Bought a refurb, and its works just as my new ones I bought prior! Came in original packaging as well!"	1
5	10-Jun-18	Black	Love it. It's like having a second wife.	1
1	10-Jun-18	Black	So far not impressed at all. Does not save groups correctly can not understand me most of the time I'm not sure what the excitement is all about. Alexas voice sounds like it's under water how am I supposed to understand!!!!I'm going to return and try a google home!!!	0
5	10-Jun-18	White	Works well and has no obvious issues from being refurbished.	1
5	10-Jun-18	Black	"Works great, can't tell it was refurbished and set up in kids mode.  I have 3 in my home and will be adding more. I love these things."	1
1	10-Jun-18	Black	"great product, but useless overall. Too many unnecessary features. Unless you have a smart home you don't need it"	0
5	10-Jun-18	Black	Worked just as good as the two new Echo Dots i preciously purchases.	1
4	10-Jun-18	Black	I bought this for my mother and she is in love with it.She loves the guard dog feature.She says that it gives her a sense of security at night and when she leaves the house	1
4	10-Jun-18	Black	I bought it mainly to be a speaker when playing music or videos on my phone. Not working for me. Read instructions but not working for me.	1
4	9-Jun-18	Black	It works	1
5	8-Jun-18	Black	"Bought two of them and both work great. I'm not much on electronics running my home, but Alexa does all that I want and need to be done."	1
4	8-Jun-18	Black	2nd one... more to come	1
3	8-Jun-18	Black	Blue light blinks all the time	1
5	8-Jun-18	White	Fun and useful. We're still learning new tricks and useful functionalities. This is the future of human to computer interface and household automation. Just like Star Trek! Who knew it would be here so soon?	1
4	7-Jun-18	Black	"Works great to control the TV lights and various other devices. Lately I've been using it when i wake up and don't know what time it is but don't want to open my eyes. Just shout out &#34;Alexa, What time is it?&#34; if i could just figure out how to get it to do house hold chores and walk the dogs it'd be golden! sound is not that great but with its size what can you expect. The Echo Plus has much better audio but that is what you get with the larger more expensive Echo."	1
5	7-Jun-18	White	Works great!	1
5	7-Jun-18	Black	Wasn't sure if I'd like this product but after having it for a little while I want one in every room! My daughter is constantly asking alexa how to spell words. We've barely tapped into all the things this product is capable of and I'm looking forward to learning all of its capabilities!	1
5	7-Jun-18	Black	A++++	1
5	7-Jun-18	Black	Great product. Works well	1
5	6-Jun-18	Black	Absolutly love it !	1
5	6-Jun-18	Black	Bought my first echo dot and loved it so I got this for work. Absolutely love it!	1
4	6-Jun-18	Black	works as promised	1
5	6-Jun-18	Black	Works great with my existing smart home setup.	1
5	6-Jun-18	Black	Perfect. Could not tell the difference from a new one.	1
1	6-Jun-18	White	I cant figure out how to use it.	0
3	5-Jun-18	White	Good sometimes can’t hear well	1
5	5-Jun-18	Black	"I was a little apprehensive about buying a refurbished electronic product, but with Amazon's guarantee, thought I would try it. Glad I did, and will probably buy another refurb product form Amazon. I love the Alexa products and have several. This one sits on my desk. Has a small footprint, but has great sound and I use it daily. Works great."	1
3	5-Jun-18	Black	Not bad bad speaker for sound	1
4	5-Jun-18	Black	"This is a great device. We mainly use it to verbally add things to the shopping list, but occasionally use any number of the &#34;fun&#34; things you can program it to do, like go to Red Alert or make the TARDIS land (yes, we're a house of geeks... we even chose the wake-word to be &#34;Computer&#34; instead of &#34;Alexa&#34;. Now we just need Majel Barret's voice and I will be in geek heaven.) ;)It's not as easy to get my Premium Spotify to work properly with it, and still not sure how we can get multiple music accounts attached so we can listen to different music in different rooms, but so far it's still been worth it. I am often asking it the time, the weather, it even gives us a news briefing. We also use it as an intercom system which has been really awesome. Plus it's fun knowing the NSA is listening to everything."	1
5	5-Jun-18	Black	We all love her!	1
5	5-Jun-18	White	I purchased this for my daughter and we all love this!!!! its amazing!! we love the games!	1
2	5-Jun-18	Black	It doesn’t always  work	0
5	5-Jun-18	White	Good as new! Perfectly packaged and I have had zero issues with the dot.	1
5	4-Jun-18	White	Love it! Bought for my granddaughter who is 3 for her to play music and ask questions. She is entertained for hours! Good buy in my honest opinion!	1
5	3-Jun-18	Black	No issues...works and looks great!!!	1
5	3-Jun-18	Black	This is a fun toy.  My daughter have me it.  It reads to me!	1
5	3-Jun-18	Black	"Refurbish Echo Dot received as new condition, as new packaging, no complaints. Neat little gadget.(Drives my wife nuts!)"	1
3	3-Jun-18	Black	"I received an Echo as a gift, loved it so much I decided to get the Dot for my bedroom. Both very easy to set up but a big difference in the sound quality. I would still buy it again."	1
4	3-Jun-18	Black	Worked as advertised. Thanks	1
1	3-Jun-18	Black	All the new Amazon products I have are great everything I bought refurbished is complete garbage. I will never purchase Amazon refurbished again total dissatisfaction	0
5	2-Jun-18	Black	Works good.  Microphone is not as good as the better Echo products	1
5	2-Jun-18	Black	Took a little work to set up but I finally got it.  Sound quality not the best but for what I got it for it works great.  I check weather and ask a few cooking questions in the kitchen with it.  I do play the radio on it when I want some music but will probably upgrade to the Echo plus for better sound.	1
5	1-Jun-18	Black	Love Alexa these are the best thing I have ever bought don't know how I ever lived with out these things amazing so happy with this product just wish it would use google to	1
5	1-Jun-18	White	I loved it it works great	1
1	31-May-18	White	Extremely low in volume	0
4	31-May-18	Black	"I had some trouble getting the program downloaded from my phone. I ended up using my computer. It is interesting that the answers come from Wikipedia. However, I will give Echo dot an &#34;A&#34; in the music playing department. I heard songs and music totally forgotten on the mainstream stations. Also amusing when Alexa responds, I don't know that. Why does she think the yards of cotton fabric refer to football playing???? If I had paid full price for this gadget I would have been sorely disappointed. Now it seems reasonable and a step above HAL."	1
1	31-May-18	White	"Brought to replace one that I moved and doesn't have the same range as my previous (non refurbished) unit. It would seldom be able to find the Wi-Fi and couldn't connect. Got tired of hearing the message (&#34;trouble connecting...check the Alexa app...&#34;) and just unplugged it. I went through the troubleshooting and reconnected it several times, it's just not as strong."	0
1	31-May-18	Black	"If you want to listen to music and have it come through several of the Echo/Dot units simultaneously, YOU MUST PAY A MONTHLY FEE. I thought this was Amazon, not Apple??!! I’ve paid for many of these so I could have one in each room, is that not enough of my money??!!??"	0
5	31-May-18	Black	"Purchased as a gift,"	1
5	31-May-18	Black	Love it	1
4	31-May-18	Black	"Overall good device. It was bought for a workout room, and has issues reaching a volume that can be heard over a standard row machine. It could use a much better speaker."	1
5	31-May-18	White	Works great and simple to set up. Alexa is way more accurate than I imagined so Im using it more than I thought. Wish alarms could be set a bit further out but thats my only complaint.No she's not listening when you don't say the wake word so if you're worried you can lose the conspiracy theories. The speaker is great too so don't hold off on getting one if you were turned off by gen 1 like me.	1
5	31-May-18	Black	The voice clarity has made my eavesdropping efforts so much easier - the government. :)	1
5	31-May-18	White	Worked perfect	1
4	30-May-18	White	"Had a little trouble at the beginning until I replaced my old router and it works good except for current temperature and at times Alexa will be off by as much as 10 degrees!  Like when it was 91 degrees, Alexa would say it was 81 degrees.  Otherwise, everything works as expected and enjoy listening to music from Amazon and my Pandora stations and requesting my favorite song or recording artist."	1
5	30-May-18	Black	I bought three of these and all three have worked flawlessly. If they weren't labeled as refurbished I wouldn't have known	1
5	30-May-18	Black	"This device works perfectly and was a good price.  We love Alexa and are having great fun with her.  The music is great and we get the radio stations we need for our morning traffic report.  I didn’t think I would enjoy having AI in the house, but it is fun, educational and entertaining even for people who aren’t tech savvy."	1
1	30-May-18	White	Eh. It’s works on and off. Half the time it does not respond when you say wake up name. Other then that works fine	0
5	30-May-18	White	Great little thing. Works better than siri.	1
5	29-May-18	Black	It’s amazing I love it	1
5	28-May-18	Black	Bought this for my son and he loves it.	1
4	28-May-18	White	"I own the first and second generation Echo Dot.  I think I prefer the volume ring of the first gen better than the buttons on the second gen, but still more than does the job and great for the price I got it for.  I'd still definitely recommend."	1
5	28-May-18	Black	Very fun to use and having morning briefing	1
5	28-May-18	Black	Arrived on time and works amazing!!!	1
5	28-May-18	White	"Just like new, set-up was quick & easy."	1
5	28-May-18	Black	"like new, good refurbishing"	1
5	28-May-18	Black	Love it	1
4	27-May-18	Black	Love my echo dot!!!	1
5	27-May-18	Black	I like that it knows my music type.The least is that it isn't wireless and the volume is not that high.	1
5	27-May-18	White	great product!	1
3	27-May-18	Black	"It works great, but the reason I'm leaving 3 stars is because it wont play unless it plugged in the whole time. Pretty irritating especially when there is no outlet available."	1
5	27-May-18	White	Works great!	1
5	27-May-18	Black	I love it ita like having a personal assistant and computer and everything else in one.	1
5	27-May-18	Black	"The problem I have with this item could just be my inexperience. I ordered the wrong thing, but then decided I’d set it up and use Alexa. I was trying to replace a small Bluetooth speaker in my bedroom. Thought I could learn as I go. I downloaded the app, but never could get the Echo to sync with my iPhone. I’ve decided to give this to one of my kids and they will probably enjoy it and use it as it is intended."	1
5	27-May-18	Black	Es perfecto.	1
5	27-May-18	Black	Working good so far.	1
5	27-May-18	Black	Working great and my daughter loves it!	1

1	24-May-18	Black	I set up the Echo Dot and it worked for an hour and then died completely. DO NOT BUY refurbished!!!! I sent back for return the day after I received.	0
1	24-May-18	Black	This Echo Dot is horrible. The volume on my phone is louder than than this device. My boss has one at this is not the case	0
4	24-May-18	Black	Overall it works very well. Some connectivity issues but it was definitely worth the money!	1
5	24-May-18	Black	Have had no issues with this refurbished unit. It performed expected. I would buy another one if needed.	1
5	24-May-18	White	Great for mom its inside an owlhead in her jacuzzi	1
5	23-May-18	Black	Works great - I put this in my son's room and use the drop in option to get his attention when he is gaming or watching tv.	1
4	23-May-18	White	It was perfect	1
5	23-May-18	Black	It looked brand nrw!! I have nothing to.complain about!! I will defently be ordering more	1
2	23-May-18	White	It's ok. The speaker is pretty terrible. Google home is a better product.	0
5	23-May-18	Black	I love it!	1
5	22-May-18	White	"I love this, answers all my stupid questions and tells me the weather for when I don’t get off the couch"	1
1	22-May-18	White	The first one quit working shortly after I got it. The next one becomes unresponsive to my voice at times and the only way to get it to work is through the app. I am not sure if it just this Dot or they are all this way.	0
5	22-May-18	White	Bought this to go in my niece's room. You can't tell it's refurbished. It looks good and works like new.	1
1	21-May-18	White	Device was not working. Followed all instructions for Alexa echo dot and it did not come on. Very upsetting.	0
1	21-May-18	Black	Sent it back due to crackling noise and turning itself off and on - but what can you expect with a refurbished item?	0
5	20-May-18	White	Best price we could find and it is so useful to have her around to answer questions. It is so handy to not have to find your phone. I also now have an intercom system.	1
5	20-May-18	Black	I have never been more satisfied with a product. Perfect introduction to Alexa.	1
4	20-May-18	Black	"Works well, but the speaker is not so grand. Getting another speaker to drop this into. In the future I would have just gone with the full size echo."	1
4	20-May-18	Black	Love our echo! Thing the full size version sounds better though.	1
5	20-May-18	Black	Works great!	1
5	19-May-18	Black	It has all I need for my life plans time date music	1
3	19-May-18	Black	Seems to have trouble hearing me when I say the wake word despite being trained to my voice... Wonder if this has something to do with buying it refurbished. Our google home mini has no problems hearing us 😬 and is much louder.	1
5	19-May-18	White	Love it!  Works perfectly!	1
4	19-May-18	White	I had a brand new echo Dot and thought that the refurbished would be just as good. It was quite different from my expectations. Refurbished unit did not even turn on and after a while I realized that the power adapter was faulty. There is no way for me to have Amazon send me a power adapter by itself according to the return options. I love Amazon and buy even my toilet paper through them but this was truly a let down.Update: Amazon contacted me and credited me enough to buy a new power adapter. This is why I shop on Amazon. I can always trust them to deliver on their products.	1
5	19-May-18	Black	I bought this for a family member as a gift. I called her to see how she likes it & she said she loves it‼️	1
4	18-May-18	Black	"Not very loud but quality and ease of use is great. Sound is perfect for background music, would suggest 2-or more connected together if you’re trying to use for hosting a louder party"	1
5	18-May-18	Black	Looked Brand new works great. I love these echo dots and the refurbished ones are like new	1
5	18-May-18	Black	My 2nd one and I use them all the time.	1
5	17-May-18	Black	"Is working like a  new one for now, l have another 3 alexa devices lm a fanatic"	1
5	17-May-18	Black	Echo is good.	1
5	17-May-18	Black	Works great	1
5	17-May-18	Black	Great price to extend the range and super value to dot offers. Hooked up wireless speaker to use working outside.This dot made outdoor sound range possible without disturbing indoor light control possible	1
5	17-May-18	Black	"Amazingly fun. My daughter and I just asked questions on the first day. I have now set my daily alarm, weekend reminder, playlist, morning shows, random songs, daily bible verses, weather, and morning commute. It tells me which way to go dodging traffic. You have to get one. I don’t have it linked to my phone yet."	1
5	17-May-18	White	Works perfect! There’s no difference at all between this refurb one and my new ones that I have in my house. I’ll be buying the refurbs from here on out	1
5	17-May-18	Black	Great product. Wakes me up every morning on time!	1
5	16-May-18	Black	Like new.  No difference from new unused original.	1
5	16-May-18	Black	"I have no complaints. As far as I know, these are exactly like new, just a little cheaper. Great!"	1
5	16-May-18	Black	Perfect condition!	1
5	16-May-18	Black	Like new	1
5	16-May-18	White	It works just as well as the new version I got as a discount with my Echo speaker. I decided to purchase this version because Amazon states it has the same warranty.	1
5	31-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"I received the echo as a gift. I needed another Bluetooth or something to play music easily accessible, and found this smart speaker. Can’t wait to see what else it can do."	1
3	31-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"Without having a cellphone, I cannot use many of her features. I have an iPad but do not see that of any use.  It IS a great alarm.  If u r almost deaf, you can hear her alarm in the bedroom from out in the living room, so that is reason enough to keep her.It is fun to ask random questions to hear her response.  She does not seem to be very smartbon politics yet."	1
5	31-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I think this is the 5th one I've purchased. I'm working on getting one in every room of my house. I really like what features they offer specifily playing music on all Echos and controlling the lights throughout my house.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	looks great	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"Love it! I’ve listened to songs I haven’t heard since childhood! I get the news, weather, information! It’s great!"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"I sent it to my 85 year old Dad, and he talks to it constantly."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I love it! Learning knew things with it eveyday! Still figuring out how everything works but so far it's been easy to use and understand. She does make me laugh at times	1
5	30-Jul-18	Oak Finish 	"I purchased this for my mother who is having knee problems now, to give her something to do while trying to over come not getting around so fast like she did.She enjoys all the little and big things it can do...Alexa play this song, What time is it and where, and how to cook this and that!"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"Love, Love, Love!!"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Oak Finish 	Just what I expected....	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"I love it, wife hates it."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Really happy with this purchase.  Great speaker and easy to set up.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	We have only been using Alexa for a couple of days and are having a lot of fun with our new toy. It like having a new household member! We are trying to learn all the different featues and benefits that come with it.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	We love the size of the 2nd generation echo. Still needs a little improvement on sound	1
4	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"I liked the original Echo. This is the same but shorter and with greater fabric/color choices. I miss the volume ring on top, now it's just the plus/minus buttons. Not a big deal but the ring w as comforting. :) Other than that, well I do like the use of a standard USB charger /port instead of the previous round pin. Other than that, I guess it sounds the same, seems to work the same, still answers to Alexa/Echo/Computer. So what's not to like? :)"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Love the Echo and how good the music sounds playing off it. Alexa understands most commands but it is difficult at times for her to find specific playlists or songs on Spotify. She is good with Amazon Music but is lacking in other major programs.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"We love Alexa! We use her to play music, play radio through iTunes, play podcasts through Anypod, and set reminders. We listen to our flash briefing of news and weather every morning. We rely on our custom lists. We like being able to voice control the volume. We're sure we'll continue to find new uses.Sometimes it's a bit frustrating when Alexa doesn't understand what we're saying."	1
4	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"Have only had it set up for a few days. Still adding smart home devices to it. The speaker is great for playing music. I like the size, we have it stationed on the kitchen counter and it’s not intrusive to look at."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I love it. It plays my sleep sounds immediately when I ask	1
3	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"I got a second unit for the bedroom, I was expecting the sounds to be improved but I didnt really see a difference at all.  Overall, not a big improvement over the 1st generation."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	Amazing product	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"I love my Echo. It's easy to operate, loads of fun.It is everything as advertised. I use it mainly to play my favorite tunes and test Alexa's knowledge."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Sounds great!! Love them!	1
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"Fun item to play with and get used to using.  Sometimes has hard time answering the questions you ask, but I think it will be better."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Just like the other one	1
5	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	Still learning all the capabilities...but so far pretty pretty pretty good	1
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I like it	1
5	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"She works well. Needs a learning command  for unique, owners and users like. Alexa “learn” Tasha’s birthday.  Or Alexa “learn” my definition of Fine. Etc. other than that she is great"	1
3	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	The speakers sound pretty good for being so small and setup is pretty easy.  I bought two and the reason I only rate it a 3 is I have followed the instructions for synching music to both units.  I know I've done it correctly but they won't sync.  That was my primary motivation for purchasing multiple units.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	This device is awesome!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I bought this to compare the speaker quality to our first generation speaker and i like the sound better.  I will ship this to my daughter though because I like the fact that my first generation has a chargeable base that we bought which keeps it more mobile and she needs a better sound than what she has now.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"Love my Echo. Still learning all the things it will do. Wasn’t able to follow instructions included in the package, but found a great one on U-Tube."	1
4	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Speaker is better than 1st generation Echo	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"This thing is way cool!  You should get one.  If you want to be cool, that is."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"This is my first digital assistant so I'm giving this a good review. Speaker is really good for the cheap price on Prime day. Fun to play with and can be used as an alarm clock (That's what I was going to get in the first place, but I ended up with Echo). If you haven't had a go with one then definitely try it!What I like best is the number of other devices that it can connect with. My purchase came with a Smart Plug for $10 which I connect my lamp to. Alexa, turn of the lights!"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	My husband likes being able to use it to listen to music.  I wish we knew all it's capabilities	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"My Android would not allow Alexa to connect. Fortunately, my sister was here with her Apple cell. After an hour+ tech support fixed the glitches. We are up and running."	1
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	So far so good	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Tried to play certain broadway shows like Camelot and it gives ne the group Camelot.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	Great	1
5	30-Jul-18	Walnut Finish 	Very satisfied with the Echo. Alexa now controls the lights in my family room and my wife can listen to Jimmy Buffet by just asking Alexa.	1
2	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"It's like Siri, in fact, Siri answers more accurately then Alexa.  I don't see a real need for it in my household, though it was a good bargain on prime day deals."	0
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Love my Echo. Still learning how every thing works but having tons of fun.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	I love you so much	1
3	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	No different than Apple. To play a specific list of music you must have an Amazon of Spotify “plus/prime/etc” account.  So you must pay to play “your” music.  3 stars for that reason.  Everything else is 👍🏻 .	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"Excelente, lo unico es que no esta en español."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"I'm still learning how to use it, but so far my Echo is great! The sound is actually much better than I was expecting."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Works as you’d expect and then some. Also good sound quality considering price (70.00 on sale) and features.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	The sound from this Echo 2nd Generation is phenomenal!  Not to mention that I just love Alexa!  She is very helpful.	1
3	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	like google better	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Just had to have it and now lets play and learn how to get the most out of it.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Works as advertised. Very easy to setup. Still learning what this can do.	1
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Great sound and easy to set up.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Oak Finish 	"Love Alexa, bought others for friends"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Love the echo I purchased it for company for my husband he is 83 and Alexa is great all he has to do is say her name and she tells him a joke and plays his favorite songs	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	😍	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Love being able to listen to music easily. Still learning all the features available	1
4	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"Did t really know what I could use this device for. Used it for a few things, but need an overview"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Love this just wish it had a built in hub	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I use it primarily to play music.  It works wonderfully!  Still getting used to some of the many things it will do.  Amazon has sent several tips since I got it. Thanks for all your help!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	How easy if was to set up.	1
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Fast response which was amazing.  Clear concise answers and sound quality is fantastic.  I am still getting used to Alexia and have not usde Echo to its full extent.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	You’re all I need...na na nana!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Does everything as expected and more.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"I love my Echo!  Works just like they said it would. I don't have a &#34;smart&#34; home, so I cannot speak about that function, but everything else about it is good."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Great sound in a small package—easy to set up and use; fun to own.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Works and sounds great.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	The sound is amazing and many collections of all music	1
4	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	Setting up	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	She doesn’t always listen	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	It’s awesome	1
4	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"I bought this because it can control fios television. It works well. I’m hoping over time it will do more to control fios. Then I discovered all the other things Alexa can do. Play music you ask for. Great sound from Alexa. Play games. Play radio stations. Play old time radio programs like the Long Ranger. Alexa has many “apps” you can add to her abilities. The other day I played Madlibs. Great fun. Also Alexa can control household appliances. I just purchased Alexa compatible power strips to control lighting, fans and TV components. I’m looking forward to implementing this controll. You can also add other Alexa components to have chosen music to play in all rooms where the components are located."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	The speaker has excellent sound and works perfectly!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I LIKE IT ALL	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I love it. It does everything	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	I was a little nervous when I received my new Echo as I'm not really Tech savvy. I found it a bit intimidating at first but it didn't take me to long to figure it out!! I'm very happy with my purchase and now thinking of adding an echo spot!!!	1
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I like it and still learning how to use it.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Great technology!! Can't believe the speaker volume and quality is so wonderful. Wish I had bought another one!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"I purchased an echo dot for my husband for Fathers Day.  He uses it constantly and after hearing the quality of sound of the Echo (2nd Generation), It was a no-brainer.  Best gift ever!"	1
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Works fine!!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	 	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Clear music	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"Fun to use, good sound quality"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	The echo works well. I was able to sync it with my other Amazon music devices.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"Works great, but I don't think Amazon should charge another cent for unlimited music when you 1) Have Prime AND 2) Buy an Echo."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Already had an Echo Dot. The Echo is even better with fuller sound. Also during setup it now lets phone calls to be made to my contact list which is great!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	The speaker sounds really good	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Good sound works well	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Love it and Alexa. I am not very savvy but support was very helpful and patient.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"Love it! I was thinking about getting one and when the prime day discount was offered, I could not pass it up! It's fun to ask Alexa to play any song or group and she comes up with a playlist from Amazon Prime Music. You can also connect your iPhone with bluetooth and play music with Pandora or YouTube videos using Alexa as a speaker. I've been having fun asking Alexa different types of questions or for information like weather, news or even the time in other countries. The only downside is if you have limited data on your wifi plan, because Alexa uses burns it up when playing music."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"We like it all so far, but have a lot to try out yet."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Love it - am using it strictly for music now and it's great!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"Love the Echo !!! I love the size, material and speaker quality. I have it hooked up to one light easily and will work on additional lights and thermostat. Next is Echo Dot for bedroom. There is a lot more to do with Echo that you think. Traffic, Weather, Trivia, etc."	1
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Love it!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	The entire family loves Alexa Echo. She’s now a part of this family.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Walnut Finish 	"Great fun getting to know all the functions of this product.  WOW -- family fun and homework help.  Talking with other grandchildren,who also have an Echo, is a HUGE bonus.  Can't wait to learn more and more and more"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Love it!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"awesome thing, love Alexa"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	It worked exactly as expected and the speaker has great sound. It is perfect for my classroom!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"LOVE, LOVE this new little gadget.  Has  made our lives so much easier.  it's like having our own personal secretary living here in the home.  We hardly need our CD's anymore, since ALEXA plays everything we need.  Going to get the Alexa DOTS soon for more rooms.  Thanks!!"	1
4	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	The speaker is of surprising quality. Happy with the purchase.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Very easy to set up. Works wonderful and I love it!!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	I'm really impressed with the sound quality when playing music from this device.  The bass sounds almost like it's coming from a bigger speaker so props to Amazon.	1
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"It’s still a great product.But the sound quality does seem worse.Don’t get me wrong. You definitely get used to it within an hour. But it definitely feels like echo gen 1 sound quality was better.Besides that , it’s great.With the addition of being able to play Just over Bluetooth with no WiFi, it’s even better."	1
4	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	The outlet does not work with it. Was disappointed in that.	1
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"Great device, responsive and helpful"	1
2	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Sound is terrible if u want good music too get a bose	0
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"i liked the sound . what is troubling is that I paid extra money to have access to a million more songs. Sometimes it doesn't work. Ex. Alexa play Italian songs&#34; .don't have or don&#34; t understand. or play the opera Tosca, response &#34;sorry I don&#34;t have that."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Easy to set up and use. Too bad it has to be plugged in. Would be nice to take it outside and operate on battery and recharged.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Still learning all the ways to use it.  It is a real hit with my grandkids who ask it to play music and then dance to it.  (5 and 7 yrs).  Very cute.	1
4	30-Jul-18	Oak Finish 	"4.5 out of 5 Stars. I generally like this product. Its great at doing what you ask of it like playing music, setting timers, and making calls. Reason why I didn't rate it 5 out of 5 is that sometimes the connection dies and my Echo stops playing music and shows a red ring. Seems to be a connection issue. Overall, great product."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"Works great, upgraded from echo dot to full size echo, couldn’t be happier!"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	It's Alexa.... what else can you say	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Upgraded from my lilttle echo dot. Happy with sound	1
4	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"Excellent product, set up with ease as well."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	I've had the first gen Echo since it first came out and it has worked well for me. I purchased the 2nd gen during Prime Day and so far I'm happy. It seems to have an improved speaker which provides enhanced sound for music and such.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I love my Echo smart speaker.  I love the volume and clarity.  It was easy to set up.  ITs a wonderful gift for any age.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	wonderful product and fast delivery!	1
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Initially harder to set up called tech wasn’t that knowledgeable now working great.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	It was very easy to set up and my family love it’s!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Has great sound and is very responsive my voice and commands.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	How did I live this long without the Echo . You get to enjoy any music style  just my asking Alexa . Going to up-greade to the wireless . Love the Echo . Love you too Alexa .	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Very cool product. Speaker sounds good with my Spotify blasting through it.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Having so much fun with Alexa. Love being able to listen to music when I’m across the room or busy doing something else.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"So far it seems to be a very nice item. It picks up on my voice and understands me without any problems. The other day I asked it to turn down the music from the next room and it heard me just fine. I've only used it to listen to music and check the weather, but it has done both of those things very well."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Love our echo	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"I love it,she is very helpful. I use her for remembering things and sleep. You can ask her just about anything. I have only had her for about a week so still learning her."	1
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"It's better than the 1st gen in every way except for one.  I really miss the ring at the top for volume control.  It was quicker and easier to just grab the top and twist without having to look at the buttons and find the &#34;-&#34; one and press it a few times.  I also wish the bass was a bit better.  All in all, it's a great device and I'm happy with it."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I love having an Alexa!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	So far I like it 🤓	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	I am thoroughly enjoying my Ecoo!  Love to have it read my audiobook to me while in the office and then I can simply open the audiobook on my kindle to continue it when elsewhere. Wonderful for listening to music when not in the mood for a book. Great for setting reminders for myself too and so much more.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Still love it	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Love it	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"I love the sound quality of this unit, it is a very clear sound."	1
4	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	I just this for listening to talk radio in the morning and turning lights on and off etc. The system does an excellent job as a full house sound system streaming Sirius.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"I have had for only a week, so I am still learning all that Alexa can do.  It is a learning process.  I love the music I can call up any time.  I listen to podcasts and radio stations.  I have just started keeping shopping lists and grocery lists, which I love.  I don’t have to search for paper and pencil.  Getting time and temperature are great, do not have to wait for weather reports.  The sound is good.  I am not fussy about woofers, tweeters, base , etc.  the Echo is fine for me.  This afternoon I am going to try “dropping in”.on my son when he gets home.  Going to surprise him."	1
1	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Not much features.	0
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"Great sound quality, great features, great product. Multi room music is very cool."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Cool	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Everyone should have an Echo or two or three or more. I bought my Echo through QVC.	1
3	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	it's annoying that everything they show Alexa as being able to do has to be downloaded. You spend so  much time trying to figure out how to phrase it for the machine that you may as well just look it up yourself	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I have had Alexa since the beginning.  I accidentally spilled water on her and have replaced it with the 2nd generation.  I decided I couldn't be without an Echo.  Setup was easy and had it working within minutes.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"I like being able to tell Alexia the music I want to hear, but sometimes she has trouble finding the song if I am not very specific about the title."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	I like the looks better than the original echo.  I moved my old echo to the basement family room. Nice sound.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	The Echo is wonderful but I'm still learning how to use it. Music requests are somewhat limited.	1
3	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"Doesn't know half the things asked. Can't recognize my sprinkler wifi controller, even though product details says it is compatible. Can't program or change my wifi thermostat settings and its matched up on same wifi router. Just a handy music player. That's if you have Amazon Music."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	Love it	1
5	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	awesome.understands my kids	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	We were pleasantly surprised at the sound quality and the many features. How nice to easily hear a particular artist or hear our books just by a simple command. Looking forward to exploring other options with this device.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Met and exceeded my expectations. Easy set up and is really quick in responses.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"I like the fact that I can get any kind of music from Prime that I want on request from Alexa. I liked the informative photo little pamphlet but wish it included how to connect your TV etc. to the commands from Alexa. BUT, I really love having the music."	1
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"i have not found a way to access my echo thorough my prime account.  I think it should be part of the top line with video, music, etc.  I also think the setup app where i define, for example music i like, is not well integrated into echo.  I have tried to ask for my playlist and echo is not sure even though i set up play list in my settings.  I also do not like the fact that my words have to be exact match of my playlist names, which i can never remember.I like the ready nature of echo to respond to most any queries."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	This is great item and just added audible books which makes it even better. Thank you!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"During Prime Day this 2nd gen Echo was on sale so I couldn't resist! This was the beginning to my smart home set up and I couldn't be happier to say that Alexa has done an amazing job connecting to all of my ""smart"" devices. Thanks to her, I can control my lights, smart plugs, TV, etc. I had no trouble connecting the Echo to my WiFi and my phone. The app works perfectly fine and it let's you add skills, routines, smart devices, timers, and so much more! Sound quality is good enough for me, since I am not an audiophile. Alexa can hear my voice even when watching movies at a high volume. Design is great and modern, it will definitely add a nice touch to your home and you can change the covers if you'd like as there are more for sale. Overall, this is a great addition to my home and enables so many possibilities. If you haven't yet, be sure to add Alexa to your home!"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Oak Finish 	Versatile and fun !!!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Works great! Killer speaker! My wife and son love it.	1

5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	so far love it working on getting more things set up love the grocery list app	1
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"It performs pretty much as expected, but I am very disappointed it will not provide me with the terminology I need to play various kinds of music without subscribing to the Amazon music service.  I understand my music choices may be limited, but without knowing HOW TO ASK, I cannot access the music that is provided free along with my Echo purchase.  Do you have a chart showing the language I need to use?"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Easy to set up.	1
3	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I like the product except that the speakers are not the high quality I expected	1
5	30-Jul-18	Walnut Finish 	A great investment. Alexa has helped me out and made me laugh.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Yet another Exho for our home and love them all!!!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"I love it, I can plan any gender of music from big band to jazz, not easy to find on local radio. Sound is good and I can stop it with a voice command if I get a phone call."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Good Value	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Super easy set up and am loving our new Echo!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Whats not to like about this speaker.  Just ask Alexa	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	BEST father's day gift. Dad joked to my mom that Alexa will be the one listening to all of his (repeated) stories going forward.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Great addition to our breakfast room kitchen.  Tunes and information instantly available.  Slowly learning more features.	1

4	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"Got this as a gift and love it. I never would have bought one for myself, but now that I have it.... Allows me to play music on it from my amozon prime music ; that's worth it in and of itself.  Also, gives new's briefs and tells jokes."	1

5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"My mom bought a few Echo Dots and repeated ask me to take one of hers because it was so great. I told her “no” for two days. When she made me take it, 6 hours later I could not live my life without it!  It’s that amazing, so now we have four large speakers and only the small Echo Dot, that I will be returning to her. I say if you’re going to order an Alexa speaker, go big and get the Echo, otherwise tou’ll Be returning the two Echo Dots you couldn’t live without."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Love it!! Great product!!!	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Easy set up very user friendly	1
2	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"Really disappointed Alexa has to be plug-in to wall socket all the time.  My fault for not checking this, but made the assumption that a company has technologically advanced as Amazon would sell this product with a rechargeable battery.  If I could return it, I would as my Apple music and boom speaker give me more flexibility the Alexa."	0
3	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I don't think the &#34;2nd gen&#34; sounds as good as the 1st.  But it does have an aux out... so you could add an external speaker.  But if you are going to do that why wouldn't you just get a dot?  2nd issue is (which isn't unique to this unit but I don't understand why I can't override the default that prevents you from playing a blue tooth speaker while playing through a &#34;group&#34;.  I get there is a delay when using a BT speaker.  But if the other units are not where they can be heard then I should be able to play as a group while using the BT speaker.	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Everything	1
3	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	I like the interaction of asking questions. I don’t like that I can’t ask her to setup schedule of off and on of connected lamp.	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Supberb sound! Definitely worth the extra money if you listen to lots of music.	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I really love my amazon echo. I think the sound quality is great and we have a lot of fun with it. It is really handy for music and to get updates on the weather and sports!	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Love it!  So do the grandkids!!	1
4	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"So far it has worked well. Not always intuitive as to how to link different devices, or ""skills"", but getting the hang of it."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Works as advertised	1
5	29-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	I love it!	1
4	29-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"Love my new addition to the house! Speaker quality is great and over all we love our Alexa. My only two ( not complaints, more suggestions for the future series) would be better communication ability. Example: For our smart lights in the house. Unless we specify kitchen Light 1 or kitchen Light 2 prior to the command she either won’t respond or says she doesn’t recognize. It may be me, but I want my Alexa to respond when I say thank you afterwards. I have to repeat Alexa thank you and there are times she won’t respond to me, but will my husband. I know it sounds odd. We laugh about it, but maybe it’s a Southern thing but I want my Alexa to have manners too."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"Like everything about it. The music, the trivia games, the weather."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	As described and received on time.  Do not like automatic enrolment into music.	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	A great device	1
3	29-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	I owned an echo for overa year but the new lacks the easy way to increase or decrease volume without telling it to increase or decrease volume which is hard to do for my wife since English is her second language she was born in korea. But the sound from the echo is superb. So we’ll keep it..	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Love this!  Have it in the kitchen and works well!	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Very nice!  I'm impressed - wish she had more to say though.	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Love the product. Nice to have easy access to so much info!!!	1
2	29-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	It's got great sound and bass but it doesn't work all of the time. Its still hot or miss when it recognizes things	0
4	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	We are still discovering all that the Echo can do.	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Amazing paroduct	1
4	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Good hearing range and sound quality. It was a bit complicated to set up and she doesn't quite understand me a lot even when I am speaking slowly and clearly but I love the flash briefing feature and interfacing with my abode home security system.	1
4	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	speaker sounds good	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Absolutely love!!	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	The best part of this product is you can control the thermostat and lights for your house.  There isn’t anything I dislike.	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	We're thoroughly enjoying our Amazon Echo. Installation was easy using the Alexa app. I purchased 2 Kasa smart plugs to control our living room lights. Installation again was easy using the Kasa app. They sinqued right up with the Echo. We're enjoying playing music with the Echo and the sound quality is awesome. We've added a Kasa smart bulb for our kitchen. Setup was seamless. We're looking forward to adding more automation to our home.	1

5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"Doesn't work with my fairly new smart TV, but that's mainly the TV manufacturers(LG) fault due to not supporting anything older than TVs from this year. My smart locks also need an additional piece of equipment in order to connect as well. Speakers sound great and works very well."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Great sound from a little speaker	1

5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Best thing I've invested in in a while thank you so much 😁😁😁😁	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"I am extremely impressed with this item. Bought it from the &#34;warehouse&#34; or &#34;outlet&#34; with a &#34;minor imperfection. Can't tell it even has one. works great. Didn't come in packaging, but it was sealed up and had no damage and wasn't missing anything. I like the sound quality, I see some knock it. It's not a BOSE but it's more than great for our family. Easy to use, minor learning curve as it learns your voice. It integrates seamlessly with my other amazon services.Can't wait to get for my classroom too! It's a lot of fun even just as a speaker, let alone what I plan to do with it."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"I love my Echo show!  and now i have this in my bedroom and it's wonderful!, music, info, sleeping sounds!"	1
5	29-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"Awesome life changer! Seriously, I am able to start my morning with Alexa, by having her &#34;wake&#34;me up with  her alarm and then playing me some music. She has gotten used to my voice, that I can be in another room and she will &#34;listen&#34; to what I say. I love both my echos!!! Don't hesitate, get one and for the price, the speaker is unbelievable. I am buying the cordless holder, so I can take the echo anywhere. Love my purchase and love alexa!!!!"	1
2	29-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"I am not super impressed with Alexa. When my Prime lapsed, she wouldn't play anything. She isn't smart enough to differentiate among spotify accounts so we can't use it for that either. She randomly speaks up when nobody is talking to her. Just today I unplugged her...not sure I'll ever use my Alexa again."	0

4	29-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	Like it to do more	1
5	29-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"This is our third echo. Worth every penny. It's like having 3 household employees for a small flat rate. We keep them in the bedrooms and the living room. We can drop-in and use them as an intercom, listen to music, answer quick questions, alarms to wake up for school, etc."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Listen music and set timer	1
5	29-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	I received the echo in perfect condition. The device was easy to set up and responds quickly and without any issues. Alexa is a great addition to our family!	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Good sound. Like it for music and scheduling. Like that i can get random thoughts recorded while I think about them. The jokes are cute!	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Purchased this for myself and am just beginning to learn all that it can do.  So far am very pleased and amazed at the different actions it can perform.  Am enjoying it and looking forward to learning more about other options it provides.	1
5	29-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"This echo is just as great as my others, even though it is smaller."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Funny how you buy something just because it looks fun and it winds up being a totally useful part of your home!!!  Loving it!!	1
3	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"I bought this to replace a &#34;Dot&#34; in my living room. Speaker is slightly better. It hears me better over the TV. Unfortunately, it doesn't understand or respond to my requests as well as the Dot. I frequently have to request 2 or 3 times to get it to do what I want. The Dot usually does exactly what I want on the first request. I don't consider it an upgrade."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"I have had all good experience, so far with the second generation Echo. There are so many more things to learn, but I have not had the time yet. Right now, I am mostly enjoying the music, weather updates, using the alarm feature, and her personality. I have also purchased some mini smart socket yes. I am very excited to begin using them"	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"I’m having trouble connecting my tv to it, but I’m not exactly tech smart. I’m sure one of my grandsons will figure it out for me. So far I’ve been using it mostly for music."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Simply love my Echo. I hardly watch any TV at all anymore. I'm too busy listening to music. Speaker is pretty goo for its size. All the fun skills really make the echo fun for my whole family.	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Enjoyed entire echo experience	1
4	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Easy to set up.	1
4	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"The Echo is an amazing device.  Many times it seems very intuitive.  But at other times I ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result.  Installation was fairly straightforward, but I messed up several times simply because I thought a step was complete when it wasn't.  This actually made me lose ground until I figured that out.  My advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step.My biggest issue of the moment is that we have several Echo devices in our home and I would like to use them as intercoms (which I am told can be done).  However, I can't make any of the Echos aware of the others existence.  When I ask Alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.  I know this is likely my fault, but I would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions.  A small deal for many device savvy people, but a challenge for me."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	We are loving Ours very much	1
5	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"I have the original Alexa and the Tap and so far the 2nd generation is the best. I'm happy to see they are making improvements with each new one.It would be great to have updates to our little A.I.'s, I think it would help out a lot with the bugs in it. All in all I am very happy with her and I can now play music throughout the whole house and adjust the bass and treble. Thank you"	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"Very pleased with the Echo 2nd Generation. It is so nice to have Alexa available for music, weather, news, and probably a lot more we haven’t discovered."	1
4	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"I am pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of the Echo. If you are a big fan of deep bass, this might not be sufficient for you though. The potential to control your home is an option I will explore more as I evolve my home into a ""smart home"". The voice recognition is very impressive. It is stylish and fun. I have no regrets with this purchase. It is great for technically changes people. Ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly. If you have an elderly loved one, this would be a great gift. Once connected to wifi, it is very simple to use.  If you want unlimited music control, be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your personal dj! You can even have conversations with the echo. I am not embarrassed to say, that echo has made me laugh a couple times when I ask it to tell me a joke. It tells me where my packages are since I am an amazon prime addict, it comes in extremely  handy!"	1
5	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Easy to setup. Love all the things she does.	1
5	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Have Alexa throughout the house----the future has arrived!	1

5	29-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	Arrived as expected.	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"Bought this a few weeks ago -  everything about this product is excellent !!!!! Don't forget to buy a charger when ordering, it's a must have to take outside by the pool and not have to worry about hiring an electrician to put in outlets all over the yard."	1

5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"My husband and I are what I would call &#34;late adopters&#34; when it come to technology, but we decide we would try and Echo to serve primarily as a music source.  Wow, were we amazed and the great sound!  We've also been having a great time listening to all of our favorite songs buy just asking Alexa.  I may even buy one for my elderly Dad - I think he will enjoy having one to listen to music or even place his calls to us!"	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"I really have enjoyed it.  Changing the Directv channels, plays iHeartRadio and Pandora , adjusts the ac thermostat and turns the living room lights and outside lights."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I have been wanting one of these for a while now.  Bought on Prime Day and absolutely love it.	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	We are so glad that we got the Echo over a Bluetooth speaker. Alexa does so much more stuff than other non smart speakers out there. I personally love the timer feature. It has helped me with cooking multiple things simultaneously. Pandora integration is another feature that I use daily. So happy with out Prime Day purchase. I will get the Echo hub and a few more Echo dots in the future.	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	See subject line.  Love it	1
5	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Love it!	1
5	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Very easy setup.	1
5	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"I was hesitant to buy the echo because I have the echo Dot and it seems good enough. The echo is the same except the sound quality, which I really didn't feel I needed. However, I am so glad I got it. What a difference! The sound really is far superior to the Echo Dot! Now I can listen to The Greatest Showman with a little more power!"	1
5	29-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	Sound quality is great. Still learning about all the different things I can do with it. FUN!!!	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Got a good deal and works great with Prime.  Setup was a bit of a pain but more the fault of crappy internet service.  Has worked great with nice sound from small speaker.	1

5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	It's so efficient and amazing!  How COOL!  We all use it often every day...	1
4	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"I’m impressed with the quality of sound that the Echo has, it’s definitely comparable to my Bose Mini. I only gave 4 stars because I can’t use my Apple Music account."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Technology in such a small device. The price was good too! The sound is amazing! A must have feature for any home!	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Mainly use it for the music but I’m learning more all the time.  Really nothing bad to say about it	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"I replaced my 1st gen, was concerned about a smaller unit not having the same sound...I was wrong.  If anything it's the same volume, and more clear.  Good product."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Great addition to my Echo Plus!	1

5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	This unit add much pleasure to our Echo Plus.  We now can have music and information through our home. (or just in one room)	1
4	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	It's extremely useful in simple things like spotify and audible and things like that but sometimes it doesn't answer everything I ask but it's still nice to use.	1
2	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Too difficult to set up.  It keeps timing out before you can enter the password	0
5	29-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"Just getting use to using the Echo. Used it for shopping lists, listening to music and as a timer. Working great so far."	1
5	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Very cool and lots of fun! Used for a week and still learning its capabilities.	1
5	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"Love it, love it!!!!!!!!"	1
5	29-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Love it but having a hard time setting up all the apps	1
