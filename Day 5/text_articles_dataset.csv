0,"The US central bank has announced it will hold interest rates steady - the first time it has opted against a rise in more than a year. The Federal Reserve kept the target for its benchmark rate at 5%-5.25% saying it wanted time to assess the impact of rate hikes so far. The bank has already raised rates 10 times since March 2022 as it battles to bring inflation under control. Bank forecasts show most officials expect rates to rise further. A majority expect the Fed's key rate to stand above 5.5% at the end of the year and one person sees it climbing above 6%. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said the bank was still waiting for evidence that inflation was slowing decisively - though it has come down sharply from its peak last year, as the shock to food and energy prices from the war in Ukraine subsides. We're just not seeing a lot of progress, he said. We're going to have to keep at it. Consumer prices rose 4% in the 12 months to May, climbing just 0.1% from a month earlier, the Labor Department reported on Tuesday. But that remains higher than the 2% rate the bank considers healthy. Prices for many items beyond food and energy continue to rise steadily. The Fed has already lifted its benchmark rate to the highest levels since 2007 to try to rein in the increases. Further rises, after a pause, would follow a path carved out by central banks in countries such as Australia and Canada, which recently announced rate hikes following a break, citing stubborn inflation pressures. The European Central Bank is expected to raise rates at its meeting this week. In the US, Mr Powell said officials wanted time to assess how the economy was adjusting to the shift to higher rates, as the change ripples out to the public in the form of higher costs for mortgages, business loans, credit cards and other borrowing. Given how far we've come, it may make sense for rates to move higher but at a more moderate pace, he said. In theory, higher borrowing costs should reduce demand for loans for homes, business expansions and other activity, eventually cooling the economy and easing pressures pushing up prices. But despite pockets of pain, such as a sharp slide in home sales, the economy has held up better than many expected so far. Fed policymakers now expect the economy to grow 1% this year - stronger growth than anticipated in March, according to projections that accompanied the rate announcement. The unemployment rate is also forecast to be 4.1%, lower than previously estimated. The estimates also show they see less progress controlling inflation than in March. Mr Powell said what the Fed will do at its next meeting remains a live question. He added that he saw no chance that rates would come down this year. The three major US indexes fell following the announcement, which suggested rates would end the year higher than markets had expected. The Fed had to do something to knock market optimism today, otherwise it risked a tougher inflation fight and deeper economic woes down the line,said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. Charles Lieberman, chief investment officer at Advisors Capital Management, said the pause was a recognition of the risk that the Feds jump in rates to more than 5% in less than 18 months could trigger an economic slowdown that would lead to millions of job losses. The bank is also trying to account for the impact of a string of recent bank failures, which could reduce lending further. Five percentage points is just absolutely enormous .... So this is a big impact, said Mr Lieberman, who previously worked at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. It doesnt mean theyre necessarily done. Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG in the US, said the public should not expect a return to lower rates anytime soon. She said the economy generally has become much more inflation prone due to factors such as increased geo-political tensions, a move to more regional supply chains, and extreme weather events upsetting food supplies and prices more frequently. Youre going to see a much more activist central bank policy with higher bouts of inflation and bouts of rate hikes than we saw from the world we left, she said. A pause is not an end, she added. They dont want to let their guards down yet with regard to inflation.",https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65896598
1,Is the US out to kill crypto Maybe Three years ago the majority of the firms in the sector that Andrew Durgees company invested in were based in the US This year he estimates that just one out of every 10 will be  a reflection of his firms judgement that the country has been growing increasingly hostile to digital assets such as cryptocurrencies and tokens The administration really has a target on the industry says Mr Durgee managing director of the crypto division for tech firm Republic The regulatory uncertainty makes the investments in the US higher risk The sector was already under pressure after prices of virtual currencies collapsed last year Further damage came from the meltdown of several highprofile firms including FTX run by the socalled Crypto King Sam BankmanFried whom prosecutors have accused of conducting one of the biggest financial frauds in US history Jolted by the turmoil US regulators stepped up their policing of the sector which authorities say has been on notice since at least 2017 that their activity runs afoul of US financial rules intended to protect investors The campaign has yielded a steady drumbeat of charges against crypto firms and executives alleging violations ranging from failing to register properly with authorities and provide adequate disclosure of their activity to in some cases more damaging claims such as mishandling of consumer funds and fraud Bitcoin which represents the biggest chunk of value in a sector in which thousands of currencies have circulated is viewed by officials as a commodity like gold That means it has been largely unaffected by the current regulatory debate which hinges on the legal question of what constitutes a security  an investment like a stock or bond that is overseen by the SEC The efforts have instead ensnared firms issuing tokens or coins to raise money  and increasingly the exchanges on which such digital assets are bought and sold which often hold customer funds execute trades and engage in other activity that is separated in traditional finance The crackdown culminated this month in legal actions against two of the biggest platforms Coinbase and Binance US sues Coinbase as crypto crackdown widens Binance accused of web of deception in US Do Kwon US regulator charges cryptocrash boss with fraud Gary Gensler the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission defended the moves this month comparing the state of affairs in the industry to the 1920s before the US put in place many of the rules in question Hucksters Fraudsters Scam artists Ponzi schemes The public left in line at the bankruptcy court Will Paige research analyst for Insider Intelligence says sentiment has soured significantly since 2021 when the industry was worth more than 3 trillion Â£24tn by some estimates and seemed poised for wider acceptance Its very much back on the fringe of finance he says Trust in the system is battered and its definitely gotten worse In the wake of the lawsuits customers yanked billions of dollars of funds US banks limited their work with Binance forcing it to stop accepting US dollars and Robinhood the trading app said it would stop listing certain assets named in the lawsuits citing the cloud of uncertainty surrounding the tokens Critics accuse the SEC under Mr Gensler of hostile regulation by enforcement aimed at boosting his own political profile They say that despite repeated efforts by the industry to propose new rules the agency has refused to acknowledge the distinctions between different types of crypto firms and the characteristics of the technology like decentralised automated processing that challenge existing frameworks Its been a very frustrating experience says Bart Stephens managing partner of Blockchain Capital a venture capital firm that has invested in hundreds of crypto firms some of which he says have been struggling to find banks willing to do business with them There is no doubt a regulatory attack is going on Bill Hughes senior counsel of Consensys a Texasbased software company that uses cryptos blockchain technology puts it even more bluntly The SEC has essentially determined that on its watch crypto shouldnt exist in the United States anymore Whether the SECs moves could actually kill the industry  in which by at least one estimate one in every six Americans has invested  is another question Cryptos wider market value remains roughly a third of what it was at its peak Trading volumes have plunged and developer interest is falling Trust remains low The failures in March of some of the few traditional banks willing to do business with it marked a further blow Hilary Allen a law professor at American University thinks crypto is inherently susceptible to boomandboost cycles and manipulation by insiders and thinks it should be banned She says the SECs actions could help reconfine crypto to the realm of tech enthusiasts given the wider state of the industry If we combine these enforcement actions with waning trust from the public with possibly waning interest from venture capital then maybe there isnt a future she says But Mr Stephens who has weathered two crypto winters already says he thinks the future remains bright  if at risk of ending up overseas given Americas current approach which is seen as less friendly than other jurisdictions including the UK and the EU He points to Bitcoins price which is hovering around 2020 levels but has gained significantly from the start of the year Ether has also risen Some indicators tracked by venture firm and cryptoinvestor Andreessen Horowitz such as the number of addresses active on blockchain and the number of smart contracts being executed are also climbing Were not seeing founders stop forming new companies or protocols says Mr Stephens who says Blockchain Capital invested more money in the first three months of 2023 than in any quarter in the previous 10 years as prices fell and rival firms backed away from the sector Even if the sector thrives outside the US losing the American market would severely limit its prospects warns Gina Pieters a crypto expert who teaches at the University of Chicago It would be a mistake to think that the US could kill the industry It can absolutely though make the crypto industry smaller she says Many in crypto are hoping for a reprieve  from the courts which could decide the SEC has overstepped its authority from Congress where draft legislation for the industry is under review or from a change in the White House which could prompt a policy reversal However those questions get decided the issues are finally coming to a head says Angela Walch a research associate at the University College of London Centre for Blockchain Technologies We are at a real inflection point she says The showdown is here,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65861096
