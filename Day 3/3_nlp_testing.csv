4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	It's pretty fun and nice to have a speaker that responds to my questions but doesn't understand my commands some of the time.	1

5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I like the hands free operation vs the Tap. We use both for controlling smart plugs.	1
3	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I dislike that it confuses my requests all the time.	1

5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Love my Alexa! Actually have 3 throughout the house. Favorite function is lists. Great for time management and if course, music."	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	This product is easy to use and very entertaining.  I have yet to hook it up to my TV or lights but look forward to doing so.	1

4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	works great but speaker is not the good for music. Will need to get a Bluetooth speaker.	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Outstanding product - easy to use.  works great	1
4	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	We have six of these throughout our home and they are great.  There are times when music or talking happens randomly that may be from sensitive listening.  There should be more options to change the name of the engagement command &#34;Alexa&#34; or &#34;Computer&#34; are a little annoying.  More colors then black and white would also be a good thing.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Use the product for music and it’s great!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Easy to set-up and to use.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	It works great!!	1
4	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	I like having more Alexa devices in my house and the sales price on amazon prime day was too tempting.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	PHENOMENAL	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	I loved it does exactly what it says	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I used it to control my smart home devices. Works great.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Very convenient	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"Este producto llegó y a la semana se quedó sin olor, perdió toda su escencia, huele solo a alcohol"	1

4	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	My three year old loves it.  Good for doing basic household tasks.  We're going to add a few smart outlets and bulbs.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Awesome device wish I bought one ages ago.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	love it	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Perfect for kids, adults and everyone in between!!"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Listening to music, searching locations, checking time, looking up weather. There are many more task to learn. It was simple to set up."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I do love these things, i have them running my entire home, TV, all my lights, my thermostat, my front door dead bolt, the cameras... and i love listening to npr. these things are well worth the value and they really shine once you stat adding smart devices and you can control your entire home like its right out of star trek.... I named mine computer to get the feel... but its amazing what you can do with these devices and smart systems."	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"Only complaint I have is that the sound quality isn't great. I mostly use it for commands though, and I have another dot hooked up to my stereo system to play music through. I have a couple friends that have a dot and don't mind the audio quality, but if you're bothered by that kind of thing I'd go with the full size echo or make sure you hook the do up to some larger speakers."	1
4	29-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Good	1
I love it.	1
5	28-Jul-18	White  Plus	My first smart buy..I am loving it and all the great things Alexa can do.	1
5	28-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"This thing is awesome!  I got it on Prime Day for a great deal.  I wish I had purchased two.  I also bought the Echo Show version, but the sound is not nearly as good as the Echo Plus.  The Echo Show came dented, so I will be exchanging it.  I like the screen and many of the features so I will not be getting a refund.  It was still worth the price."	1
5	28-Jul-18	Black  Plus	Is great having a new friend	1
5	28-Jul-18	Black  Plus	Coop product many uses including smart devices throughout the home	1
5	28-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"Easy setup with great sound, I would rate this unit a 10 +++++, and a must have for the office and home. l am looking add other devices (locks, and lights) for my home."	1
5	28-Jul-18	White  Plus	Better than expected!	1
5	28-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"Wonderful, still learning how to use. Had a heck of a time setting it up, but is happened somehow."	1
5	28-Jul-18	Black  Plus	It's fantastic. Very happy with the purchase.	1
5	28-Jul-18	Black  Plus	Love it!!!	1
3	28-Jul-18	Black  Plus	I like the list ability and the music I can play.  I do not like that I can not create a playlist without using the app and even then Alexa will not play my songs I have to do it through my tablet or phone.  I also do not like that Alex can not print again it has to be done through the app.	1
5	28-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"It is a great bundle of fun. Music ,games, questions etc. I luv it turns off my smart lights. I purchase 4 more smart light for my lamps in the living room and my room!"	1
5	28-Jul-18	Black  Plus	First time using Alexa and so far I love it.	1
4	28-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"It was a little hard to follow their instructions, great product"	1
5	28-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"This was a replacement. It was really easy to set up. I had to reauthorize my smart items to work with the new hub, but installation was easy and instructions were clear."	1
5	28-Jul-18	Black  Plus	Really cool device that does a ton of stuff. Fun games like Jeopardy. We used this to set up smart bulbs and light switches. Make sure you ge the stuff that corresponds with this particular hub. Had to make a few runs back to the store for exchanges.	1
5	28-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"I’ve been waiting for Prime Day to purchase an Echo Plus and now, I’m enjoying learning what Alexa can do. With a new Sonos One and an Echo Dot, I have the makings of a really nice and well-integrated smart home. Love it!"	1
5	28-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"I haven't had it very long, but so far our whole family is enjoying asking Alexa questions!"	1
3	28-Jul-18	White  Plus	"Although this is my second echo device, I am still very disappointed that there is almost no documentation/instructions as to the many functions of the device.  I purchased becausse of the sound quality, but only found out it has bluetooth capabilities last night by accident.  There needs to be a manual that details all of the functionality of the device.  Or at least point out where it can be found..."	1
5	28-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"The Echoplus is a great extension for the Echo Dots in our home. I am a little disappointed that Alexa is not as good at information requests as Google. But as a start on home automation, she is very impressive."	1
4	28-Jul-18	Black  Plus	I never had ALEXA before but the biggest reason I bought it was for YOUTUBE and apparently YOUTUBE stopped supporting it and that is why it will get 4 stars.... it's mostly YOUTUBE's FAULT but I worked around it by using my cell phone as a blue tooth connected to hear things but still takes the voice activate purpose away but the speaker is amazing to hear my youtube watch later playlist	1
5	27-Jul-18	Black  Plus	Awesome!! Loving Alexa	1
1	27-Jul-18	Black  Plus	no habla espanol	0
5	27-Jul-18	Black  Plus	Love the music the stories	1
5	27-Jul-18	White  Plus	It is fantastic.	1
4	27-Jul-18	Black  Plus	Like it but it will take time to setup all the skills I want simply because there are so many. I already use music and Flash Briefing daily. Very satisfied. I use this along with Alexa app on my Kindle hd8	1
4	27-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"Wish it would have came with the lightbulb, but otherwise works great, fast delivery, and I enjoy using it!"	1
5	27-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"Still haven’t learn all the Echo can do, but so far, quite pleased!"	1
5	27-Jul-18	White  Plus	Love it!	1
4	27-Jul-18	Black  Plus	I can receive my CPR classical station.  Great sound.What I like least is the learning curve and my mistakes.	1
3	27-Jul-18	White  Plus	"Sounds well and we find it useful overall but it can be frustrating when it doesn’t respond or you forget the correct command.  “Alexa, turn on the living room lights”.  Oops I mean “Alexa turn on the family room lights”. I also never realized I call my couch a sofa some times.  Unfortunately my Alexa is confused by my changing names for where I sit."	1
1	27-Jul-18	Black  Plus	no it is broke and I can't get help fixing or replacing it	0
2	27-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"I’m still unable to connect any devices although it says it has a built in hub. So bought a bridge to connect the devices thinking that everything would sync and my other devices are still not discovered via my echo plus and I was looking forward to this feature. Being able to play music, check the weather etc is fine."	0
5	27-Jul-18	Black  Plus	sounds great have not used the hub yet	1
4	27-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"Is as expected and more, responds very fast to given commands and was very easy to connect via the Amazon App. I also bought the PhilipsHue Light Bulb and all I had to do was put it in my lamp and tell Alexa to find my device and it connected and the lamp now turns on and off with voice commands."	1
4	27-Jul-18	Black  Plus	Sound is better	1
5	27-Jul-18	White  Plus	It is as if we are having a conversation with another person.  Instantaneous response.  And the fact that it catches your command even when you're far from it is simply just amazing.	1
3	27-Jul-18	Black  Plus	Although I haven't taken advantage of many of the Echo's features there is one that bothers me. It starts talking even when I haven't said anything even close to the wake up word - ECHO - had to change from Alexa due to a conflict with another device.	1
5	27-Jul-18	Black  Plus	The echo plus is very straight forward and easy to use.  It plays great sounding music and can do lots of other things.  Still learning what all it can do.  Working very well so far.	1
4	27-Jul-18	Black  Plus	We have used for last 2 weeks. We like it. My children also like it. Alexa has become part of our family.	1
1	27-Jul-18	White  Plus	Terrible. Stopped working after one day.	0
5	26-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"better sound than my echo dot. Simple to set up, less than 5 minutes."	1
4	26-Jul-18	White  Plus	Nice toy to have around!	1
1	26-Jul-18	White  Plus	"It does not speak in Spanish,,,I bought it for my grandmother to have someone to talk to when I’m not around,,,,,no Spanish!"	0
5	26-Jul-18	Black  Plus	Love all the cool thing I can do!	1
5	26-Jul-18	Black  Plus	Great product	1
5	26-Jul-18	Black  Plus	Like it. Still working discovery. Really too soon to fully evaluate. But looking forward to learning and using it.	1
2	26-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"When I got this Echo I was excited to have a device with better sound than my Dot and a hub to control some Hue bulbs.What I didn't realize and also wasn't fully communicated to me, is that you can't use Hue bulbs to their full potential with this device. You can only turn on and off the lights and set them to a number of preset colors. You also cannot update the bulbs to the newest firmare which is a security concern for me.Do not buy this if you want a full featured hub for your new IoT devices. If you do, you will end up needing to update to a standalone hub, which makes the hub inside this device redundant and pointless.I still love the echo and have zero complaints about the Alexa functionality or sound quality of this device. I'm only disappointed with the hub's functionalities."	0
4	26-Jul-18	Black  Plus	Still needs some work on commands. Sound is equal in the regular echo so if you don't need a smart hub get a regular echo. The sound is ok with it had as much bass as my old soundlink but I mean hey gets loud on the treble and sounds clear.	1
5	26-Jul-18	White  Plus	"I love my echo plus. I use it with my Spotify account, to find my phone, make phone calls,  turn our lights off and on, much more. Most importantly it reads story to my children.  They love it and that makes me happy."	1
5	26-Jul-18	Black  Plus	Excellent why didn’t I think it is in the beginning I love it	1
5	26-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"Bye bye Philips hub and expensive monthly internet charge!  Took a little tinkering, had to rest the individual bulbs, but works great! No more, &#34;Philips hue bridge is not responding&#34; message."	1
5	26-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"Works great! Exactly as described. Only complaint I have is sometimes Alexa gets confused with smart home product names and i had to go back and change some stuff around, but i chalk that up to my inexperience with smart home stuff."	1
5	26-Jul-18	White  Plus	I love it. Use it mostly for the music huge repertoire to choose from	1
5	26-Jul-18	Black  Plus	Very easy to hook up. Download the app and it walks you through the setup	1
1	26-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"I am so disappointed in this product.  I tried to install two different units and neither one of them were successfully completed.  Hours with Amazon technicians.. resetting each of them.  The app didn't connect the Echo Plus to the internet connection.  Tried using the application on a phone, a tablet and on a Chromebook... No luck.  There are no clean directions on the application.  Probably sending this back to Amazon..mark this as Not ready for prime time."	0
5	26-Jul-18	Black  Plus	Well behaved device that i enjoy using.	1
5	26-Jul-18	Black  Plus	Easy setup and sound quality.	1
5	26-Jul-18	Black  Plus	I really love the hub feature	1
5	26-Jul-18	White  Plus	What a blast!  We love Echo...  Just learning all the tricks but lots of fun and helpful too!	1
5	26-Jul-18	White  Plus	Love this!	1
5	26-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"Great sound quality, works well with smart home devices"	1
5	26-Jul-18	Black  Plus	Use way more often than we used our Google Home.	1
3	26-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"Mic hears everything but only understands about half the first time, it often takes multiple tries until it gives the correct result."	1
4	26-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"Nice add on to a home.What I don't like are the limitations, for example world soccer. It won't give you much info of sport teams other than American."	1
5	26-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"I was a little apprehensive about buying this because I saw reviews saying it sounds like crap. I'm no audiophile by any means so maybe it's that, but I think it sounds great considering the size. It fills my living room with sound and gets pretty loud while remaining clear. I haven't had any issues pairing with my devices or utilizing any of the voice commands. I have it paired to an EcoBee3, my Firestick, and a Phillip's Hue light bulb. I plan on adding devices as I go. I love this thing and I'm glad I scooped it up! I have only had it around 2 weeks. Will update if I run into issues."	1
4	26-Jul-18	Black  Plus	I love my Echo Plus. The only drawback is that there is no battery so it has to be plugged in at all times which makes it inconvenient  to use outdoors.	1
5	26-Jul-18	White  Plus	"Great device, my grandkids had a ball setting it up for me!"	1
1	26-Jul-18	White  Plus	The alexa is awesome but when i rcieved the light buld i did not know that u need another adapter to have the light buld to work. I was not aware of that.  Disappointed	0
5	26-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"The Echo Plus is great! So easy to set up and with the built in hub, it connects to other Alexa devices with a mere verbal command. I am 62 and not super techno knowledgable but this was easy for me. Have my lights integrated with Alexa and now looking at security cameras and locks. Definitely recommend the Echo Plus!"	1
5	26-Jul-18	Black  Plus	Works as advertised! It says Alexa is always learning. That's great because I am just learning all the things Alexa can do.	1
5	26-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"Great , love it."	1
2	26-Jul-18	Black  Plus	wish it had a battery or was described better as a plug in only item.	0
3	26-Jul-18	White  Plus	Doesn't seem to hear as well as my 2nd Generation Echo and WHY is there no volume buttons on it?!	1
5	26-Jul-18	White  Plus	A+	1
5	26-Jul-18	White  Plus	Worked great. The built in hub works great.	1
5	26-Jul-18	Black  Plus	It knows everything  we ask it to do. Havent smart hubbed it yet but does exactly as advertised and am very happy with our purchase. Sound quality is excellent also	1
4	26-Jul-18	White  Plus	"Connecting and sound are perfect! I only give 4 because the is no internal battery, if I disconnect to the power source, it will be off."	1
4	26-Jul-18	White  Plus	"It seems easy to stump Alexa with rather simple questions that are easily googled with the correct answer.  We admit that we have not explored all that's available through the Echo.  One irritating issue is that Alexa cannot answer help questions concerning how to use the system, rather it refers you to the Alexa app or help via a computer.  It was very simple to setup and use and we continue to learn how this tool can become more useful."	1
4	26-Jul-18	Black  Plus	I like how easy it was to set up. Very easy to use and set up with other Bluetooth devices.	1
5	26-Jul-18	Black  Plus	Ease of use and many tasks it will perform	1
5	26-Jul-18	White  Plus	"I purchased the Echo Plus with built-in hub during Prime Days sale. It was delivered very fast and was easy to link to my WiFi. Also connected it to a smart plug to control a light. I love telling Alexa to play music, and she hears me from 2 rooms away. Excited to learn new uses for it."	1
2	26-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"It was harder to setup then I thought it should be, for some reason I had to default  it twice. Had to go thru too many steps to setup and find my devices. Would be nice if it could interact with my Xfinity cable tv cable box and it also does not work with my Xfinity alarm for my house or my cameras, be nice set and disarm the alarm with Alexa. Had to install a skill app to setup bulb ??? whats that about, you ship it with your product ??? should have said (Alexa setup bulb) or (Alexa find new bulb) ??? and (Alexa setup Nest)??? it's fine that you use third party apps but Alexa should do the work for you."	0
5	26-Jul-18	White  Plus	Nothing to dislike I love my new toy that has made my house a smart home.	1
3	26-Jul-18	Black  Plus	The built in hub lacks some of the features (geo fencing) of the Phillips hub.  Otherwise would have given it 5 stars.	1
5	26-Jul-18	White  Plus	The Echo Plus is used for leisure and pleasure. I absolutely love it. Easy to set up and connect. What a great addition to my listening pleasure. I have not used it yet for other purposes.	1
5	26-Jul-18	Black  Plus	Arrived right on time and works as expected	1
4	26-Jul-18	Black  Plus	It's like a remedial form of the Star Trek computer in your home	1
1	26-Jul-18	Black  Plus	The echo part works fine.  The hue hub is a disaster.  It worked for a few months and then nothing.  I spent 2 hours on the phone with tech support one =y to have to send it in for repair.  I am now trying to reconnect my lights.  What a pain.  I am having to reset each light bulb.  It can take up to 5 times to get it to reset.  I have spent hours on this.  I will say customer service was friendly and tried to be helpful.  Stick with the echo and smart plugs for lamps.	0
5	25-Jul-18	Black  Plus	I love it and my family loves it also we use it all the time we also like playing the games that you can get on it too!! Great for family game nights	1
1	25-Jul-18	Black  Plus	It was supposed to come with a free Hue lightbulb on Amazon Prime Day.  No light bulb arrived.  False advertising!	0
3	25-Jul-18	Black  Plus	 	1
5	25-Jul-18	Black  Plus	Awesome!	1
1	25-Jul-18	Black  Plus	Haven't had it a week and already it cannot connect to my network. Tried reconnecting manually and the echo never appears in the list of devices to connect. It will be on it's way back to Amazon	0
5	25-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"This is the 3rd unit I purchased all the way from gen 1 to the plus. The only reason I purchased this is because it works so well and I wanted it in other rooms as well. All my switches work great and I have had not issues. I the past, I did have some ghost commands when Alexa would answer a question when no one asked her to but I think some recent ipdates May have resolved this. It just keeps improving over time, not with call capabilities. I work with adapting smart homes and this is by far the cheapest, best way so far. Can’t wait to see what they come up with next."	1
5	25-Jul-18	Black  Plus	Love it. I play music everyday and voice  activated makes it so easy	1
3	25-Jul-18	Black  Plus	I can't get multiple profiles working. It just spins when adding a 2nd user at pass device prompt	1
5	25-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"I love it , using music and turning on and off light"	1
5	25-Jul-18	Black  Plus	It has great sound and very responsive to commands!	1
5	25-Jul-18	Black  Plus	This thing is great. Has good sound and does everything I expected. I have it linked in with my lights and use it with alarm.com as well.	1
5	25-Jul-18	Black  Plus	No problems whatsoever makes life easy and sounds great.	1
5	25-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"This is a very useful device.  I use it to turn my lights on and off around the house.  It works with all the other Alexa devices, so I can give a command near any of them, and this will process the request.  It also handles all the functions that the other devices can do. I enjoy it much more than I thought I would."	1
5	25-Jul-18	Black  Plus	I love my echo plus!!!	1
5	25-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"How can you not like the Echo Plus.  It has the built in Hub and works seamlessly with all my compatible devices.  Amazon makes a great product and I haven't had a single issue with this one or any of the other devices (echo dots, etc.)."	1
5	25-Jul-18	White  Plus	"I have been hesitant to purchase anything smart home because I am just not good with electronics.  However this surprised me how easy it is to set up and it links to the Bluetooth in my sound bar for my TV which provides extra sound for music, I can make calls and finally hear people when home. I do not have cable, only the paid apps like Netflix and Hulu so when Alexa provided me news stations, weather and other updates it was really great to hear! I have linked all of my accounts to her, she turns on my lights before I walk through the door. She purchases re-orders off of Amazon for my pets and I heard if something bad happened at your home she would place a call to 911 regardless if she was unplugged or not.  This is important as an extra layer of protection for someone living alone.  My tech savvy bf went out and bought her after a week of me having her. Must buy!!!"	1
5	25-Jul-18	White  Plus	"I love my Echo Plus and have cousins from Italy here visiting and they love it.  I want to give them each one, however will it work for them in Italy. someone please answer my question ASAP."	1
5	25-Jul-18	Black  Plus	Totally enjoy our new Echo Plus.  Great for fast facts and listening to Beautiful Music.  We are just getting started with all the benefits.	1
3	25-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"Device is touted as able to link to calendar on my Samsung phone through google, can't get it to work"	1
5	25-Jul-18	White  Plus	Love this product!!	1
5	25-Jul-18	White  Plus	Music. News. Shopping list. Jokes. Games	1
5	25-Jul-18	Black  Plus	Works well. Need to speak clearly but picks up commands from a good distance and the sound is surprisingly well.	1
1	24-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"I'll be returning it.  It's been nothing but annoying.  The hub can't be turned off if not needed and it interferes with my Hue Bridge.  I can't even install Philips lights with it unless I unplug it to do so.  There are plenty of other reviews that go in depth with the issues.  Bottom line is it sucks as a hub.  It doesn't support z-wave and zigbee (which in fairness I knew in advance), but when the one protocol it does support doesn't do many functions that a dedicated one will, what's the point?  I noticed right away that my Philips Hue Bridge supports firmware upgrades to the light bulbs themselves and this doesn't.  I found that rather interesting."	0
5	24-Jul-18	Black  Plus	 	1
2	24-Jul-18	Black  Plus	The Echo does not link to Direct tv even though they said it would. I have spent multiple hours on this. Made phone calls and texts. Also is missing free bulb.	0
5	24-Jul-18	White  Plus	"Still learning what it can do. Amazing. Simple, works right out of a box. Only frustration is getting Amazon Alexa app t show up on my Samsung/Galaxy with Google's Android."	1
5	24-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"well what can you say,  Love It  Love It  Love It  enough said"	1
2	24-Jul-18	Black  Plus	Doesn't use apple music.  It is worthless to me without it.  Sound quality on it is also poor.	0
5	24-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"Great product, easy to install and use! Not a necessity but a commodity!"	1
4	24-Jul-18	Black  Plus	 	1
5	23-Jul-18	White  Plus	"Works great I bought this Direct from amazon, and I have got to tell you, This item Echo Show and Echo Plus is the best item I have ever had and I am kind of a tech geek. I am a disabled person, and it helps me turn light on and off, and schedule doctor appointments, using google voice phone, and get my medical rides to and from hospitals, plays music on cue from multiple web apps, and watch videos, as well as communicating to my Nurses aide my schedule and calendar of events. I wish there were programs that helped disabled people get these and smart lights. They are literally the best items since chocolate to assist the disabled and literally anybody else who need them. Although the echo show is not a hub once you set up the Echo plus hub with your lights you can use any amazon device to shut the lights off. Thank God, no more working my ass off to turn on or off lights. Thank you Amazon. I will save up enough money to buy more gift cards from Affirm.com to purchase 1 more of each and some lights for rest of the house. Jeff Bezos these are awesome items and because of your allowing me to get amazon prime at a lower cost due to disability I was finally able to buy these items on your prime day event. really helped when all you earn a month is $672 on SSDI thank you all again."	1
2	23-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"I'm sure the Echo is as cool as everyone says....but I won't get to try this one. Even though I have a Large covered porch.....the package was left on my top step on a day forecast for 100% chance of rain.....and rain it did, soaking the package. I'm not even going to open it and see how bad the damage is. This order has been cursed from the beginning. Ordered as a Birthday Gift and Delivery was not made on scheduled day. Now I get it, and its rain-soaked."	0
5	23-Jul-18	Black  Plus	So far I love it.  It was easy to set up - if I can do it anybody can.  Speakers are great and its fun to play my music with just a voice command!	1
1	23-Jul-18	Black  Plus	I am not tec smart enough to make it work at all. Will send it back if I cant get help. My eco dot works just fine. this is too complacated.I just wanted a bigger speaker.	0
3	23-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"We are a long time Amazon Prime family, many years, but new to the Alexa world and thought the purchase of Alexa Plus, with hub, and included Phillips Hue light bulb would be a great start. Alexa does a lot of good things for us like Alarm in the morning, verbalize books, playing music on command, even linked to my Sirrius/xm account. Good daily stuff. Good sound, but not Bose. But, the ads say &#34;Hub included&#34; so don't need anything else to operate devices. Well, not so. I understand there will be some differences in product device  support. The fact that it came with the Hue light bulb works only for on /off/ dimming of the bulb. The bulb is capable of so much more with the Hue App but the Hue app does not recognize Alexa hub as a bridge. So, it appears you do have to get a Philips bridge to set the bulbs for scenes, time the lights when you are away, set color tones, etc. That can all be done via internet with your phone or tablet away from home. The list goes on for its capabilities but not without its own bridge. Was very disappointed to find that out after the fact, to the point I feel we are being misled by Amazon by included the Hue bulbs without explanation. Maybe throw a good discount my way to get the Hue bridge if I keep the Echo Plus before I invest in more light bulbs."	1

4	22-Jul-18	Black  Plus	I love it but does not play well with my Amazon Prime... many shortcomings and potential fees	1
5	22-Jul-18	White  Plus	Item as described and delivered on time.  Thank you	1
4	22-Jul-18	White  Plus	I bought 2 of these (plus 2 Echo Dot 2nd Generation) on Prime Days. Love the Echo Plus easy to setup. The reason for the 4 star is the fact that one of them did not arrive with the free Philips Hue White A19 Single LED Bulb Works with Amazon Alexa. There is no one to call to find out why.	1
1	22-Jul-18	Black  Plus	Product does not.  Light bar never went orange.  I googled it and reset instructions actually differ from package instructions. I tried both.  Product is defective	0
5	22-Jul-18	Black  Plus	Exactly what I wanted with speedy shipping.....thank you so much!	1
5	21-Jul-18	White  Plus	Easy to install	1
5	21-Jul-18	Black  Plus	I have an original Echo and really like it. I wanted another one for my basement. I realize it isn't a huge stereo with settings but it doesn't sound bad at all. Definitely doesn't take up much room. Great price for the Echo Plus on Prime Day. I ordered two!!	1
5	21-Jul-18	White  Plus	"I bought this on prime day and saved lots.I have 3 large blue tooth speakers in my house that I used for years, the echo plus was louder than all 3 combined at the same time. Very impressed with the clarity and volume.You will need a paid subscription to some form of steaming audio. That’s just a sad fact. It’ll play pandora and Spotify but it’s limited in skips and song selection without a subscriptionDoes not stream YouTube music or YouTube audioApple users will be disappointed to see that it’s not as convenient as an apple deviceOverall, I still loved the device but I’ll be getting the DOT which has an audio out jack (as does the echo plus) and just connect to external speakers"	1
2	21-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"I have been thinking about getting this for a long time and was excited when it arrived bundled with a Philip Hue bulb.  The excited ended quickly.  I spend about a total of 4 hours attempting to add this bulb to my Alexa Echo Plus.  Everything I tried, ended in a Discovery Failed message.  I tried to set this up over and over and over again.  I watched YouTube videos.  I read set up websites.  I was the poster child of insanity (doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results).The next day I went onto Amazon to get the tech support.  I was hoping something would be done to make this thing work, but also the problem not being operator error.  Well after 3 tech support staff and 1 hr. and 19 mins. of being on the phone, it still didn't work.  This product has tested my patience.  So far this experience is shifting my mindset from going to a smart home to just kicking it old school.The only reason I gave this two stars is because Amazon will be sending me a different Echo Plus and light bulb.  The problem wasn't the bulb, because before packing up the items, I purchased another bulb and still Alexa couldn't locate this device.I pray the next attempt is successful and then I will revise this rating, but what are the odds that I was shipped a defective Echo?  The support person had the same thought.  Maybe I should be exploring the Google device but I can't get over the look of that hub.  It looks like a defuser.I can't believe I didn't find YouTube videos that show the problems I did.  Everything looked simple and seamless...NOT the experience I had.  OK, I'm done with this review because I spend enough wasted time this weekend already."	0
4	21-Jul-18	Black  Plus	Got this in a pretty good deal during the prime day event. It sounds pretty good and works well so far.	1
5	21-Jul-18	Black  Plus	very nice and its does not take up space	1
5	21-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"I'm an original purchaser of the Echo when they came out with a limited few in their test phase and I've always loved it. I expanded my Alexa usage by adding a few Echo Dots around the house and finally decided to jump and buy an Echo Plus. Let me tell you what, GREAT choice! As much as I love my original Echo, the Plus was an obvious upgrade immediately noticeable. The sound is great. And the fact that it's got a built in hub for the Philips Hue lights is a huge plus!"	1
1	21-Jul-18	Black  Plus	received the wrong product...was so excited to install it ...all excitement gone. Thank you Amazon.	0
4	21-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"I’m having trouble with it, the alarm most of times doesn’t work, the timer doesn’t ends... and Alexa keeps saying she is unavailable."	1
5	21-Jul-18	White  Plus	Love it just wish I could play my amazon music on both my devices without having to buy an additional subscription	1
5	20-Jul-18	White  Plus	Sounds a little better than the original plus it now has an interrogated Zigbee hub.  The hub is compatible with the GE Link bulbs.	1
4	20-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"I got it to try side by side with the Echo originale. They are essentially the same in dimension, weight and the woofer is the same save for the smaller tweeter point up instead of down and the built in hub. As many folks already pointed out, the hub is not a direct replacement for the Philips Hue, Z wave or anything else. It provides a sub set of features available from the stand alone hub and you ended up losing functionality that you took for granted on the dedicated hub. For me, the voice recognition and music play capability is the same, the original Echo may have an edge on the volume department due to larger speakers. The new Echo plus is priced lower than the original Echo with the built in hub but I don't really need the hub with less functionality. In addition, I don't think that Amazon will have software updates for this hub as other dedicated hub would have so bugs could end up never fixed. My Philips hub gets software update probably once every couple months and it keeps up with the changes in the new bulbs FW and they fixes bugs. Net net for me, this Echo does not do anything more than the original Echo and sound quality is not as good. With the  original Echo available as refurbished I would check that out first before considering this or the new Echo which is clearly inferior to both of these."	1
2	20-Jul-18	White  Plus	"Why do we need to buy a $100 hub to get it to work with Samsung TV's and many other devices?  I want my money back!  This thing won't even turn on my TV unless I buy another hub.  What's the point of having a hub that doesn't support half the devices out there?  DON'T buy this thing unless you want to spend another $100 on another hub.  It won't work with many of your devices.  Just by the Echo or Dot if you must but not this.  Better yet, get a Google device.  They actually understand you when you talk."	0
5	20-Jul-18	White  Plus	"I love it, in my living room"	1
5	20-Jul-18	Black  Plus	Absolutely love it..  only thing that would make it better is if was rechargeable.  When playing  music with  Bluetooth speaker outside I have to go inside to change songs.	1
1	20-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"I only purchase the echo plus because it has a built in hub and came with the free philips hue bulb.  When I got everything set up, I realized the echo plus hub won’t allow full functionality of the bulb.  All it does is turn the light on/off and dim.  It will not change colors.  You still have to have a Hue Bridge to have full function of all the features of the bulb.  I wish I’d bought the bulb and bridge separately to use with the echo I already had since the built in hub on this echo will essentially be useless and I’ll have to buy the hue bridge to get the full benefit of the lights."	0
2	20-Jul-18	White  Plus	"At a volume setting of half or less, the speaker sounds like there is something rattling, crackling or vibrating in it.  I'd understand if the volume was set higher.  All speakers get distorted when over-driven.  But this doesn't sound like this is an over-driven case; sounds like more of a rattle/crackle.  Possibly because the bass is too high.  Learned that there is no ability to adjust any of the sound characteristics (other than volume).  I will attempt to exchange it assuming it is just an isolated problem."	0
5	20-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"the Sound is fantastic for the Classic  music. is like you have the orchestra at your home. and you can control the sound with out screamig at it you just have to twist the top, but also you can tell  &#34;Alexa volume 3&#34;"	1
5	20-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"love Alexa, makes it fun when people are around and seeing it for first time"	1
3	20-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"I was suppose to get the “free” lightbulb with purchase. It did not come with Echo. Upon reading more carefully, it says to click a box to receive free bulb. 😳 of course I want the free bulb, who wouldn’t? Just a sneaky way for them to get out of having to give so many “ free”  bulbs away. Disappointed!  I have yet to set up my echo, our first purchase on any alexia device. Debating if we want to keep it. It did come quickly with my prime membership."	1
1	20-Jul-18	Black  Plus	I bought this for myself and i didn’t realize it had to be plugged in just to work. It isn’t convenient to make them always have to connect to a wall. It should’ve been more clear when i bought it.	0

5	20-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"Incredible piece of technology.I have this right center of my living room on an island kitchen counter. The mic and speaker goes in every direction and the quality of the sound is quite good. I connected the Echo via Bluetooth to my Sony soundbar on my TV but find the Echo placement and 360 sound more appealing. It's no audiophile equipment but there is good range and decent bass. The sound is more than adequate for any indoor entertaining and loud enough to bother neighbors in my building. The knob on the top works great for adjusting volume. This is my first Echo device and I would imagine having to press volume buttons (on the Echo 2) a large inconvenience and not as precise. For that alone I would recommend this over the regular Echo (2nd generation).The piece looks quality and is quite sturdy with some weight on it. The rubber material on the bottom has a good grip on the granite counter-- my cat can even rub her scent on it without tipping it over.This order came with a free Philips Hue Bulb which I installed along with an extra one I bought. I put the 2 bulbs into my living room floor lamp, turned on the light, and all I had to do was say &#34;Alexa, connect my devices&#34;. The default names for each bulb was assigned as &#34;First light&#34; and &#34;Second light&#34;, so I can have a dimmer floor lamp if I just turned on/off one of the lights by saying &#34;Alexa, turn off the second light&#34;. In the Alexa app, I created a 'Group' with &#34;First light&#34; and &#34;Second light&#34; and named the group &#34;The light&#34;, so to turn on the lamp with both bulbs shining I just say &#34;Alexa, turn on The light&#34;.I was surprised how easily the bulbs connected to the Echo Plus with its built in hub. I thought I would have to buy a hub bridge to connect to my floor lamp power plug. Apparently there is some technology built directly inside the bulb! I was surprised by that. Awesome.You will feel like Tony Stark on this device. I added quite a few &#34;Skills&#34; like 'Thunderstorm sounds' and 'Quote of the day' . Alexa always loads them up quickly. Adding songs that you hear to specific playlists on Amazon Music is also a great feature.I can go on and on and this is only my second day of ownership.I was lucky to buy this for $100 on Prime Day, but I think for $150 is it pretty expensive considering the Echo 2 is only $100. In my opinion, you will be paying a premium for the Echo Plus and you have to decide if the value is there for you:1) Taller and 360 sound unit.2) Volume knob on top that you spin (I think this is a huge benefit over buttons)3) Built in hub for Hue bulbs. After researching more, there are some cons to this setup if you plan on having more advanced light setups. For me and my floor lamp, it's just perfect.I highly recommend it and will buy an Echo dot for my bedroom now."	1

1	19-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"I would like to tell you that I have a reason to hate it like the speakers suck, or the color, or the shape or even the way it smells, but I can honestly say the number reason I hate this device is I have tried to set it up 3x's now to no avail, I have 4 other Echo devices already that I set up and use quite regularly, I have reset my phone (Galaxy S8), checked the app for updates, I have cycled power to the Echo unit with each attempt. I work in the network/technology industry for a living and have for over 20 years now, so lack of experience or knowledge is not the problem here. I used the app and the device even tells me it is connected and to follow the app to continue set up, the set up screen just continues to roll the 3 dots around the screen for about 5 minutes before the app locks up on my phone and I have to force the app to close, restart my phone and the Echo and try again. I figured 3x's was enough, it shouldn't be that hard a techie, I can only imagine how bad this will prove to be for people whom have no clue about technology....I hope they won't call me I'll tell em to send the product back!"	0

I also have a Dot which is Bluetooth linked to a Grace Digital amplifier which is driving a couple of floor standing Snell speakers, obvious the floor standing speakers are better than this but not by much. My only complaint is that you can't customize Alexa hot words. Now that I have multiple Alexa devices there needs to be a way to direct an Alexa command to a particular device. I would like to be able to talk to a device by name."	1

3	16-Jul-18	Black  Plus	"Pros- plenty loud for a large room with high ceilings.Cons - the hub doesn’t do anything.  It doesn’t work with z wave (as it states), it doesn’t take voice commands for SmartThings, which I had to buy since the hub doesn’t work for z wave.It also sounds muffled and there is no way to control the EQ. (Not sure if that is on all models, but the Dots we have are clear.For the money, buy an echo dot or echo (2nd generation).  The echo dot takes voice commands for the smart things hub, go figure, and the audio is clear. The dot also seems to hear my voice better and almost at a whisper."	1
3	16-Jul-18	White  Plus	"Alexa is a decent speaker if that's all you need. She is terrible at most other things. She consistently answers questions that were not asked or says &#34;hmmm I don't know that&#34; for everything else. We've gone back to just using our phones because she can't really look anything up. Pretty much everyone makes fun of me for spending money on this when I had an awesome Bose bluetooth already. I bought her because my mother (who lives alone) uses hers a lot and is happy with it, but we have a full house with kids and I'm less than impressed. I'd never recommend it to anyone except for senior citizens who love alone and need to be able to shout out for help in the event of a fall."	1
5	16-Jul-18	Black  Plus	The setup of this device was simple and effective.  I am very pleased to see all of the additional skills and add on abilities of Alexa.

4	15-Jul-18	White  Plus	Alexa is great only she will laugh or add random comments in conversations. Last night I was asking a sibling why they are using Alexa upstairs versus the one downstairs. Then the echo dot downstairs starting singing “oh technology oh technology” kind of weird but it seems to have a mind of its own.	1

4	14-Jul-18	Black  Plus	Alexa was able to call my phone when I couldn’t find it and also turned on and off the light when commanded.  Then I came home a day later and it wouldn’t turn on the light but would shut it off.  Then she said I had no devices; couldn’t find my phone.  Now working again.  We will see.  Love the selection of music!	1
1	14-Jul-18	White  Plus	"I will be returning this piece of garbage as soon as possible. With my lifetime Amazon spending approaching nearly $40,000, I’m sure I’m just a small customer to them, but I’ve rarely been so disappointed out of hundreds if not thousands of Amazon purchases.I have 8+ echos for home automation and bought this Echo Plus specifically for the built-in hub along with approximately $600+ in zigbee light switches. The voice control is subpar even when it works, and that is a rarity. Most often it does nothing. I could not be more disappointed with this product and strongly discourage you from investing in the Amazon/Zigbee ecosystem. If you value your money, and expect a working product then you need to look elsewhere"	0

5	11-Jul-18	White  Plus	Very easy to set up and use. Slowly adding devices to truly make our house a smart home. Both Alexa and I are learning what we can do.  With each new item I am happier that I made the purchase.  So far my only regret is I didn’t do it sooner.	1
5	11-Jul-18	White  Plus	"Get this in white. I bought it for my girlfriend in white and I wish I had it in white now. Alexa is one of those devices you will always use and miss when it's not around. I find new uses for Alexa every day. I've Incorporated this device into so many parts of my daily life. As Alexa learns more I learn more. She's my alarm clock, she reminds me of important dates. I'm constantly asking her for information like travel, entertainment, science, history, politics Etc. She turns on and off lights, she's the core of my smart home."	1

3	6-Jul-18	Black  Plus	This is the best Amazon speaker with Alexa in it.  But if you’re thinking it’s a good smart hub you’re wrong. Are you can do is connect your smart lights and devices to it and tell Alexa to Turn them on and off. That’s it! You’re better off buying separate hubs so you have more control of your devices.	1

4	3-Jul-18	White  Plus	"Was debating between a 4 and a 5 star review. The one challenge with the hub is that Phillips has added functionality that only works with their hub. Basic functionality works with this unit, but now I need two apps to set everything how I want it instead of one, which has caused some user issues. It's woken up a couple times without the trigger word, which I find highly unsettling. We have minor issues with it not always picking up what we say correctly, but it's usually just one or two repeats if that happens.The speaker is great quality and easily covers the kitchen/living room. The sleek design is not obtrusive. My girlfriend has had fun interacting with it and we've had entertaining conversations with it."	1

5	30-Jun-18	Black  Plus	"I love the Echo Plus mainly because I don't have to worry about putting a CD, in to play. I just command a song and it plays. However; I was disappointed to learn later that it needed to stay plugged in unlike the Echo. After consulting with Amazon and learning that I can purchase a portable Echo charging station I'm good.Sincerely,"	1
5	30-Jun-18	Black  Plus	We love this.	1
2	29-Jun-18	Black  Plus	"As an echo its great, Good sound quality and functionality. As a smart home hub, it sucks. No automation, no geo-fencing, no music syncing for hue, no z-wave. All it does is turn things on with your voice. Ended up buying a smartthing hub and transferring everything over."	0
5	29-Jun-18	Black  Plus	We have a great time using this as a family. Even my toddler can talk to her . There are a few features I wish it would learn to do  but overall we love it and glad we brought it over the Google home !	1
5	29-Jun-18	Black  Plus	great	1
1	29-Jun-18	Black  Plus	"Got this a few months ago with the idea that it will help control my smart bulbs and be useful with answering questions and getting daily weather updates.It’s far from being useful.Half the time when you “wake” the device to ask a question or initiate a command, it doesn’t hear what you say and turns off. Basically ignoring you. Often she is unable to answer basic questions.It’s been so frustrating. Alexa has been more work rather than making my life easier.I would return it but I’m past the return period...... zzzz"	0

3	30-Jul-18	Configuration: Fire TV Stick	Works very well for Amazon and Netflix but will not a let all viewing platforms like VUDU. It also will shut down if HULU is played for more than a couple minutes and yes I have it directly plugged into the wall so low power source is not an issue (even checked outlet voltage) an issue which is typically the answer you get for that issue.over all the quality of the picture is quiet well and is a user friendly platform to use If they would fix those two issues I would have one on every tv in the house but as it sits this will be our only one. to bad to because I relay like amazon products and having Alexa is always nice	1

5	30-Jul-18	Configuration: Fire TV Stick	This firestick is everything!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Configuration: Fire TV Stick	"Recently cut the cord on cable television. Needed an easy to install and relatively inexpensive alternative option to fill the gap. Ordered the Amazon Fire Stick from Best Buy. Instructions were short and easy to follow. I was going to order the Amazon Ethernet Adapter because I was worried about wireless speeds in my area, but thought I'd wait and see. Glad I did. Wireless connection has proved almost flawless so far. A few brief hiccups here and there, but I'm convinced that was from the Apps themselves. Don't miss the ridiculously high cable prices and am able to watch most of what I used to watch for a much lower price, which right now is a total of $50 a month. Amazon Fire Stick is limited to 1GB of memory and 8GB of storage. Thought that would be a huge issue when it came to downloading Apps and recording shows. So far it hasn't been any issue at all. The upcoming fall tv schedule, which includes the return of NFL Football, might prove more troublesome when I need to record more often. I'll worry about that then. My only real issue is that you can't really turn it off. The screen remains on and uses up electricity, although probably small amounts. Luckily when you unplug it, all downloaded Apps and recorded shows stay in memory. Not sure what happens when you have something scheduled to record when it's unplugged. Haven't tried it yet, although I don't think it'll be an issue with DirectTV Now, which I'm using right now. So far I'm loving the Amazon Fire Stick. Actually love that Amazon, which I use occasionally, come pre-installed."	1

Only downside is if you pause the movie for more than a couple minutes it takes a long time to come back on and you often get a message that your internet speed is too slow (I'm clocking 300 mb at my house on a good day).  Also, voice command through Alexia doesn't work well, but that could be operator error.  All in all, for $20 you can't beat it."	1

I really like that I can download all the apps for different media sources like HBO, Showtime, etc. that I have free access to from my cable account but with the Firestick I get a better picture and can go directly to the shows I want to see. The downside was the time it took to download all the apps and set them up, but the good thing is that the setup is a onetime procedure."	1

4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I bought the echo dot while it was on sale for prime day and I was excited when it came in the next day. I set it up immediately and everything worked perfectly fine. The set up was easy and straight forward which I really appreciated because I am terrible with technology. The only reason why I am not satisfied with my purchase is because of the fact that I can't use the Echo Dot for more than 15 minutes without it disconnecting from the internet. I am connected to both 2.4GHZ and 5GHZ wifi links and neither works. It's very frustrating because I am not getting my use out of the Echo Dot and I really wish I could. If any one has had the same problems or has any solution please let me know!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I got this for dad on father's Day!  He was tickled with it!	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Nice product	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Love my echo. Love playing music in my room	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Still getting used to Alexa, but I think she's a keeper!"	1
4	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Works good for the most part. You ask it some questions and she says she doesn’t know. I thought she was supposed to know everything	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	my new best friend :)	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Absolutely love it!!!!	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I liked linking two more rooms in the home	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I LOVE ALEXA!! SHE ROCKS!!!	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I had some trouble with my echo dot when I first got it because of internet connection issues. After doing research online I saw from some other people that they had trouble with the 2nd generation Echo Dot. However, the same weekend I took a trip and brought my Echo Dot along to the hotel where it seemed to work just fine. Now back home, the internet connection has seemed to have gotten through it's little rough patch and I haven't had any problems since. So, if you are having connection issues with an Echo Dot then it is probably the internet and not the device."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Small size works great in our sunroom.	1
4	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	I like it and it’s helful but it can only do certain thongs that is supported by amazon.	1
1	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I reached out to Amazon, because the device wanted to sync my phone number but it would not allow because it said my number was already in use.  Customer service couldn't help they basically told me to contact Sprint to assist.  So Echo does the bare minimum without access to my phone for set up, so its kind of pointless to have and pay for."	0
3	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"It won’t work as a blue tooth speaker with my tv,it connects but won’t work"	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I've only got to use it for a couple of weeks before having to go into the hospital, but had good time with it for the short time I did use it. It was fun trying to use Alexa"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"This was an impulse buy but turns out I really enjoy my new dot. My grands love requesting songs and playing games. I like listening to my audible selection, keeping up with my to do lists and discovering new Alexa skills. Fun and practical, my echo dot has been a surprisingly welcome addition to my home."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Great product at a great price.	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	My son loves his Echo Dot.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Love these.  Great in the bathroom to listen to the news during showering.  Or listen to CNN live with Serius SM.	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	I like it alot. I connected it so I can play my Pandora and I asked about the weather & time every morning. I got rid of my old fashioned digitol clock because I can have my music play Unlimited on this. I'm going to ask it about vacations and a few other things once I get more comfortable with it. Definitely worth the money.	1
4	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	It plays music that I request.	1
1	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I didn't like that almost everytime i asked Alexa a question she would say i dont know that or i havent learned that.	0
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Luv it.  It's a great product.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"What can I say. Well, I’m a  paranoid IT person of 30 years but got hooked on the idea of cloud based home control. So yes I love my echo stuff but, I did create a isolated VLAN on my home network to run the devices including the cheap ones that require you to sign up on some questionable website and download their app. Be carful with these people!  Entering your Wi-Fi password on a site that’s not vetted and your location when the app askes is not a good thing. Try to stay with devices that  work directly with the Alexa hub with no third-party app, Amazon has more control of these types of devices and how the  sensitive information is handled."	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Great product	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Very helpful for playing music, setting alarms, and talking to you when you are lonely."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Easy to set up, can control Kasa smart plugs no problem.  Even the kids have figured stuff out that I would not have asked Alexa, like telling jokes and singing. The Alexa app controls my custom spark plug and my cloud cam."	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I love having Alexa around the house. My favorite features are her timers, alarms, and music. Especially her library of sleep sounds. I got this product as a gift for my kids, and they love her too. She is great for reading time, and timing 30 minutes for it.The only thing I really don't like, is that she HAS to be plugged in to an outlet to function. No ifs ands, or buts. I get why, but it is minorly inconvenient, as I have to move her from room to room, or purchase more. Lol"	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"Alarm,bed time story, universal"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I am in love with alexa	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Its was easy to set up	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	 	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Works better than anticipated. This thing is awesome.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Great product	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Really like it	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	I like that it respond most of my comands. Great product.	1
1	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	The volume is very low	0
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	so far i am liking it although i am probably not using it to the full capasity	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"My new best friend!! I'm a little behind the times I've never had anything like this, another alexa or google home, so to me this is a super amazing useful tool. I use it to play sleep sounds to sleep. I use it for my amazon audible books. Set alarms, reminders, receive notifications, play games with her. Have her tell me a short story lol. It's pretty fun. I know some people complained about the speaker I'm not sure why. I'm sure if you have an open concept house all to yourself and want to blast music no this might not blast it around loud enough. But I rent a room and in my bedroom it's perfect I don't have any problems with the speaker. Love everything about it!"	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Wish volume was capable of going louder	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I love it	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Best purchase this year.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I love these, I have 2 dots and one echo. For a medium size rooms these are loud enough without external speakers although I do use external for the dots."	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I really love my dots! So awesome how it’s connects all my rooms. But like you’ve read with other reviews they are definitely lower in volume. Which I’m sure if I connected it to speaker or another device it would be great. But as a stand alone the volume is just ok. Definitely not like my tall echo. And the dots don’t pick up voice as good as my tall echo.Still totally love them and would recommend 100%	1
3	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	its okay but keeps dropping wifi!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Kids love it! I love it!	1

5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"We have 3 echos now, even one in the barn, great idea for when I am working with my horse, can still get news flashes & my music!"	1
3	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I bought this for my healing room.  I play continuous spa like music. Although Alexa knows the type of music needed, the device does not deliver quality sound it sounds muffled.  I didn't know I had to buy speakers too."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Like having the music where ever I am.	1
3	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"Hard to hear, had to blue tooth it to a better speaker."	1
3	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"No problems, works as expected. Could have a better speaker."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I love it...... I want to get another one very  very  soon	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Great to have along with the Echo	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	this is my 2nd echo dot and it is working just as i want it to.  i have it in the bedroom and i par it with a small blue tooth speaker.  last nite i went to sleep with sounds of a thunderstorm as provided by my echo dot.  i am planning to have the dot turn my bedroom lamps on when i receive the smart plugs that i ordered.	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"daughter wanted a white boombox, nothing good out for 11 yr old.  decided to go echo dot for most any request + white BT good speaker.  she loved the gift and nice option for many things on the internet."	1
1	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Cheap and cheap sound.	0
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	This is pretty cool	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Some times Alexa is a little &#34;thick&#34;, but mostly good!"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Love it!! Don’t know what took me so long to get one — and don’t know why I didn’t get two on Amazon Prime Day!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Up dated news	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Works like a champ.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Clear sound, great alarm clock, plays my music.  What else can you ask for.  Oh yeah, you can order what you need."	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Love that you can use your cell phone to call Echo or Dot. You can also use Echo and Dot as intercoms.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	love it...just like the other 4 I own.	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"Great price.  I love my echo dot,"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Excellent. Bought another one yesterday!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	works great	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Love this!!! My daughter enjoys telling Alexa what to do. Haha	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Purchased this for a discount on Prime Day to insert into a portable Bluetooth speaker made specifically to work with Echo Dot. Works great, love it! Now I can bring Alexa out onto the patio with me, and I mostly use it for music. This is our 3rd Echo product and we love them!"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Just got my third one. Love them	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	The ease in installing	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Un excelente equipo inteligente al estar conectado al internet nos provee de múltiples funciones tales como, el tiempo,hora,información de cualquier estudio que estés realizando atrás vez del internet."	1
2	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"For the price, the product is nice quality and has a few nice features. So definitely no complaints there. The reason why I only gave it 3 stars is because the echo dot is not what I thought it was going to be so that may just be buyer error. First, I didn’t know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work. So I really don’t like that it’s not a stand alone device. Also, the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a Bluetooth speaker, don’t. Lastly, I’m sure the echo dot can do a lot but I haven’t quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own, plus setting it up was awful. I would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually “Alexa”."	0
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I love this product so far only because of the few things I can do with it...such as set a timer, a reminder, play music and games. I don't like that to get the full enjoyment from it that you have to purchase so many things. It was also very difficult to set up. The directions made it sound as simple as one, two, three but they forgot about step four, five and six. I was almost ready to send to back.The app is extremely slow and it took hours to get this thing set up. However depending on what you are going to be using it for I think it's an ok item."	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Love the echo dot it’s amaxing!!!	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I like to use it for listening to podcasts.  I like to set up the greeting in the morning to tell me what's new.  The one thing I don't like was getting it to recognize the radio station I wanted to listen to.  I finally got it working, but had to work through the bugs."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Just like it's big sister, the Echo, only smaller, with slightly less audio fidelity, but much lower price (on amazon prime day:-)Used in another room to add Alexa to an additional room."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	It does everything  the big guy does	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Great product - understands my accent!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Love it... can't stop using it..	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Really like the availability to get instant music throughout the house.	1
3	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	 	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"very handy in the kitchen, sets timer and gives me extra help on setting oven temps."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Cool little speaker..I love her alarms and connected it to my speakers and it sounds great!!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	It is s great tool helping with information.	1
1	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Used twice not working!!!!!!!	0
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Awesome piece of technology that has simplified my life. Great purchase.	1
3	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I jumped on the bandwagon by purchasing an Echo.  I feel like there was a struggle getting connected and then three days later, the device is sharing news and weather.  Now we use it some, but have not tapped in to all options.  Still testing it out."	1
4	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Love Alexa. Love the Echo Dot but we have trouble with the speakers when using the intercom.	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"Love it , Now if I can only find the correct smart (links)Plug to connect this too"	1
4	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Work pretty well	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Still learning it	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"We really love our Echo Dot, we can get questions answered right away and play any music we can think of."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Usual reliable Alexa	1
3	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Speaker could be better qualty	1
1	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	This device does not interact with my home filled with Apple devices.  How disappointing!	0
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Have the echo wanted something smaller in another room  they work together great	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Love it!! It is so handy and easy to use. Got it for my classroom, but I many need to just get another one."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Very pleased	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Primarily for music in our bedroom.  I wish the speaker had better fidelity.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Nice	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Music, weather, time."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Great, love it!"	1
2	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Not all that happy. The speaker isn’t great and for some reason a lot of times when I play music it will start to make some weird noise and just stop. My son has a google home and it is much better	0
3	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Not impressed	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I really like it .	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	it takes a while to learn the uses and I'm still learning!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Alexa is phenomenal!	1
2	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"When you think about it this really doesn’t do much. Play music, answer stupid questions, finally it was able to hook up to thermostat. I can see why price is dropping like a rock."	0
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"The Echo Dot (2nd Generation) Smart Speaker is very compound in size, however it  projects very good sound. It also has a port in which you can connect an external speaker  for greater projection of sound. I also like it size because it's not awkward, and it doesn't take up a lot of space. It works great with the Alexa App. I also think the size is great for college students who live in dorm rooms with small limited spacing."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I use the echo dot several different ways in my home. I use it downstairs to control lighting. I also take it out on my deck to stream music to a Bluetooth speaker. It works great for what I need.	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	I have an echo but wanted a dot for my bedroom. It was even easier to set up than my original echo.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Makes turning on and off things in the house so simple. Great for little updates as well, like checking the weather and such."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Great product, fun to use!!"	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Needs to be smarter	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I really enjoy being able to just make a request  for my favorite music and it happens I have no complaints at this time...	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Love it. Works great making my home a smarthome	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	I really like the echo dot. It’s amazing to be able to set an alarm or timer just by talking to the echo dot.	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Convenient and fun.	1
4	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	It's alright....	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	this is my first Alexa enabled device and so far its lived up to its reputation!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I love searching the Alexa skill shop on the app. Useful things like having Alexa turn my lights on and off, listening to news updates every morning. And fun stuff like telling Alexa to make the Star Trek red alert nois. Or playing song quiz with friends."	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Second dot.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Son loves it.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I love how compact it is.	1
1	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"This worked well for about 6 months but then stopped connecting to the internet (wifi) and none of the trouble shooting efforts worked.  Amazon customer service couldn't help further and told me warranty was only 3 months, which was very disappointing, so they weren't willing to replace."	0
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"It talks to me, plays the type of music i want to listen to, and even turns off when I ask if to."	1
2	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Ask it to play Motown radio on Pandora and it keeps asking if I want to add a salsa station. Motown isn’t close to salsa phonetically.	0
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Love it, we are still learning the capabilities, having a lot of fun."	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Easy to set up. Still trying to get it to connect to a light bulb smart plug. Grandkids think Alex is cool!	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	I love it! I use it for everything. It’s a part of my daily routine	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"The Alexa program is great, but the quality is not the best. It could definitely be louder."	1
4	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Overall I like this. Though Siri on my phone can do more for what I need as I don’t have a “smart home” and don’t intend to make it one. But it’s fun and I use it for music and to have it read me my audible books.	1
3	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Alexa is pretty basic and almost like a toy. Shouldn't have been released into the market without proper development. Speech recognition fails to understand basic American and British Accent.The music it can play is very restrictive. Speech isn't refined in a way that we understand a (almost a) human is speaking. Linking to Youtube via amazon web services doesn't work.	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Set up is so easy.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Love it	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I'm amazed with the alarm. I tell Alexa to wake me up to a particular song and it does.  I love the play list if music. Not sure if i don't keep prime if music will still be available. However i did love the fact Amazon gave me music free for 3 months...they should have given prime free for 3 months as well.	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	I love all of the things that it can do. I can play with it and learn from it.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Been debating on getting one, but am happy I did! Still more to explore. Thanks!"	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"I'm finding more and more uses for this all the time. It keeps me informed with news and weather, I can get a daily Bible verse, and have it play music. New skills are added all the time. The future is here!"	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	I love to watch my wife argue with Alexa.  I woke up one night listening to Alexa talking to my cell phone. ????	1

5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I love this its super convenient and makes my life a little easier	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"I love my echo dot. Has many features and works great.The only thing I don't like about it, is that I can't play my iMusic on it. I'm going to have to pay for a Spotify or Amazon music account."	1
4	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Its Great. Lots Of Fun!!	1
4	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"Easy setup. Alexa needs a lot of training,"	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Third echo dot purchased. Love the product.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I like the compact structure of the Dot. The sound is a little too low.	1
4	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"Handy if you don't expect much out of it much ""dumber"" than the assistant in my phone."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	It's easy to set up and use. There are new features and skills added all the time.	1
3	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Love the product but dislike that I can’t sync up my Apple Music for Alexa to play	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Have had for just one week so far and I can say it is a blast to have.	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	love it	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Works like a charm.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Good speaker for bedroom or office	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Small speaker tin sound. Great with good Bluetooth speaker.	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Fun and  information.  No dislikes  so far !! Like the convenience!!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	It was easy to set up and affordable! Love it!	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	I love that I can shut the microphone off at night so my children can’t talk to it at bed time and she has an automatic sleep timer for their lullaby music. Not sure how I survived with out this for so long.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Echo Dot and related devices are the best thing to come in a long time.	1
3	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"The sound quality wasn’t great, but it was inexpensive"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Works great... bought it for my shop so that it is like an intercom to the house.	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	It isn’t bad for what it is. Have issues with it actually playing what I want. Getting it use iHeartRadio properly by playing the station I want is a challenge but it’s not bad for the sale price I paid.	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	It’s great but sound quality is very low	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	I love it.	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"As Always, easy to set up"	1
3	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	It works OK. This speaker quality is not much better than my iPhone X. I would spend the extra money to get the full-size echo which has great sound quality.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Very intelligent, love the songs ...."	1
4	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Review	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I love my Echo Dot!  The price I paid during Prime Day was comparable to buying a new digital clock with the bells and whistles, but this does so much more.  I can play music, set alarms, call friends, play games, set timers...the list goes on and on.  Definitely worth the money."	1
2	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Sound is terrible. Cannot pair with echo to play simultaneously.  Must upgrade to amazon music if you want to play more than one device at a time.	0
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Easy installation and set up. Better sound from the Echo Dot Smart speaker. Very satisified with purchase.	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"I am spoiled by one downstairs...so got this one for upstairs to listen to music , etc. while I walked on the treadmill."	1

3	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	The commands Alexa requires are too specific.  I find Google home to be much more flexible in figuring out what I'm asking for.	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	HANDY AS HELL 10/10 RECOMMEND	1
1	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	I am having real difficulty working with the Echo Dot. Alexi is not very smart. 9 out of 10 questions I have asked I get the &#34;I'm not sure&#34;  Half the time I am still asking the question and Alexi is saying &#34;I'm not sure&#34;. The music is great and works well for that. All in All so far it's been a very frustrating experience.	0
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"We are still in the discovery phase, but so far we are enjoying the smart home features we have installed."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Totally gets out sense of humour	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	We put one in the bedroom.  It plays music and tells us the weather.  It also is an alarm to wake us up in the morning.  It is better than a clock radio.  It will play any type of music you want from radio stations or your own favorites.  It can even tell jokes.  I don't know how I got along without it before now.  Amazing.	1
3	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I like the Echo, but not sure about the Dot.  I use it a lot for music and Audio books.The sound quality of this smaller Echo is nowhere near the quality of the full sized model.  I haven't decided if I'll keep it or not!"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	LOVE it. I got this for my boyfriend for his birthday and his kids have a blast asking Alexa all kinds of questions and having her tell silly jokes. We love it.	1
4	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Better sound.	1
3	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Got this for my 2nd Echo in the house, I already have the regular Echo.  The Echo Dot was easy to set up but the sound is not enjoyable, wishing I would have just gone with another regular Echo solely based on sound."	1
1	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I was really happy with my original echo so i thought I'd get an echo dot to use in my bedroom. I was really disappointed in the audio quality so I connected an external speaker via bluetooth. The audio was much better but I started having problems with it loosing connection with the wifi, presumably due to interference from the bluetooth. Then  I connected a speaker via the auxiliary jack. when i did that, the auxiliary jack picked up interference from the wifi and I was woken up in the middle of the night by a horrible buzzing sound. im hoping Amazon will take this thing back and give me a good deal on an echo spot which I hope will be a better nightstand device."	0
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Listens well, does way more than expected, love her!"	1
4	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"We are still testing this one out and so far, we like it. I was very hesitant about putting a voice activated device in our home and this would be our first. Unfortunately, it sometimes gets our WiFi light bulbs mixed up and won't turn them on but we've been able to manage and fix it. I mean, it's convenient, especially for those unable to reach to turn off lights or electronics that you could hook up to the Dot. I do like that it plays music and has reminders, alarms, etc - I'm just still getting used to the fact that The Man is always listening now."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Works great.Having fun playing music,checking weather,a king questions."	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Small convenient and dependable. This dot is a cutie and Alexa does the job you ask.My only issue is the fidelity which is to be expected in a such a small speaker	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Alexa is perfect for people like me living alone. At least I have someone to talk to.. to keep my sanity. 😂 Though I wish it has a powerful speaker and no need to connect it to bluetooth speakers.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	small footprint.  nice clarity.	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Easy set up	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Great addition to my Alexa base. Using it in my guest bedroom for music, clock and info.Dot speaker is not as strong as the base but it's a great value"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I had an Alexia built into my thermostat that just didn't work very well. I had to be standing right next to it for it to hear me and music played very choppy on it. I decided to try the Echo Dot since it was on Prime Day. I have not been disappointed! It hears me just fine and music plays with out any problem. I really like that I can Bluetooth connect to my Bose Speaker for quality sound.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I connected it to my whole home sound system to play prime music which my Google Home mini can't do.  It works well.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	this is so much fun to play with - I just ask to set an alarm to wake in the morning and when it goes off I tell Alexa to turn it of - Alexa learns from the questions I ask. SHe will play music that you ask her to play if its the amazon music domain. If I wake up in the middle of the night I do not have to turn on a light I just ask alexa what time is it. When I want the current weather she tells me. Ask her what going on in the city she knows. Call a friend she will dial ( I haven't used that one yet but she said she could if its in y contacts.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Easy to set up and does everything it’s a poster. Despite its small size the speakers are adequate. Understands instructions from across the room. Very happy with the purchase.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"A great product for the price, works well!!"	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Perfect for a home office	1
2	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Weak sound. Compared to the Google Home Mini the sound is bad. Also you need Prime to have a small selection of music and need prime music to play everything. Also if you get two you need prime family music to play music on both. I think it's lame that you need a family plan to use multiple devices.	0
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	It does what it's suppose to do great product.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I love this item and being able to hear any kind of music.  I enjoyed it so much that I ordered another.	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Love the dot	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Great item.  I'm so glad I made the purchase and on Prime day.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I'm still learning how to use it.  I figured out it can read my kindle books to me, which is a real bonus."	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Love having one in our bedroom and in the kitchen. Great to drop in on family around the house.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"So far so good.  Not to tech savvy so, I'm still trying to figure out what I can do with it but, it was easy to set up and so far easy to use.  Lots of apps that it can use.  I will have to play with it some more but its fun to have."	1
1	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Echo Dot responds to us when we aren't even talking to it. I've unplugged it. It feels like it's &#34;spying&#34; on us.	0
1	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	NOT CONNECTED TO MY PHONE PLAYLIST :(	0
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I had put this off for awhile but finally got around to buying 3 of them for my home. My wife is legally blind and cannot use the computer. This has been a Godsend, 100%. We have the Amazon music for her and now she can listen to music, check the weather, get phone numbers, make calls, etc., etc.. We are still learning but I tell you, this is absolutely amazing. I purchased 4 more for my extended family and the grandchildren absolutely love playing their music on Alexa. With the wifi and direct cable capability, the speaker/stereo options are there for the choosing. This is well worth the money. You won't regret this at all!"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Perfect!  Fast shipment and packaging.  Worked as intended.	1
3	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Alexa seems to get dumber and less useful all the time	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Love it!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I'm addicted to this thing.	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I love my Dot and am hoping to add a couple more around the apartment. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish the speaker would be just a little better. I know Amazon probably wanted to keep costs down for this item but I really like to play music around the apartment when I am busy doing things so if they would have added a speaker with just a little more wattage and bass response they would have something great to put in the bathroom or kitchen where there might not be a lot of space for a full sized Echo. I would have been willing to pay 10 to 20 dollars more if it had a better speaker. Oh well it is what it is and I still love it. I'm just going to have to find a Bluetooth speaker that sounds good but doesn't take up a whole lot of space.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	So far all.i can say is I love it	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Love my dots.  Easy to use.  I have two plus the Echo Spot.  One of my favorite features is the ability to listen to music ... AMAZON, IHeart Radio, Pandora."	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Great to play music throughout the house. Great and easily fits in my decor of my home	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"I'm obsessed with Alexa. She tells me the weather every morning, she can play games (we love the guess the song one!) and the one we have upstairs can turn off our TV downstairs which is so cool because why walk down the stairs if Alexa will do it for you????"	1
3	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Works well. Just disappointed with the speaker quality. But hooked it up to old computer speakers.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Easy setup, easy use, work with other smart products, always learning what it can do"	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	We have so much fun with this!  So easy to use that even my four year old loves talking to Alexa!!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I love my new Echo Dot! Right now, I mainly use it to play music at night, but it gets the job done."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"We love this thing! I wish I would have gotten it sooner. You will certainly want to go through the settings and lock it down if you have kids, but it is a great additional for even unexpected things like helping the kids with homework. There are loads of skills. I am very happy with this purchase, especially since I got it on prime day for almost half price."	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Super easy to hook up and program. I use the music feature the most but I love how I can set reminders from my phone and my Echo will remind me at the set time. It’s great for my news updates too!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	It works just like my other Dots.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Set up was simple. It recognizes my voice well. It seams very intuitive. I am enjoying its ease of use.	1
2	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	The only negative we have on this product is the terrible sound quality.  A massive difference from the Alexa.  Which to us was a big reason we wanted to purchase this.Won’t be buying another until the speaker and sound quality can improve.	0
3	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	I was hoping the cord was white also. Otherwise it is fine.	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"I like that she has the ability to do multiple different things like create a to do list, set and alarm, play any song I can think of and much more. I wish the sound could be a tad louder."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Too soon, I'm still learning what I can do with it."	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Enjoying it and still learning all the commands.  Ran into one frustrating issue.  It was not user friendly when trying to set up voice recognition for a household.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I love the option where u can play music everywhere in the house when you have multiple devices	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Works great!	1
4	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	I like almost everything	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"AMAZING. It has helped me become better organized, gives me traffic updates, weather updates, and helps me maintain a good, fast morning routine."	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"My kids love Alexa... Skills are amazing, would like to see her get a little smarter answering basic questions"	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Great. Definitely gets a little old after a while but for $30 I can't really regret it at all. Love having it hooked up to my speakers via bluetooth and waking up to The Smiths.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Love it. Added it to an upstairs bedroom	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Got to love Alexa she does everything around our house	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Works great and easy to set up!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	My 3rd echo device. Very easy to set up. Works perfectly.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Easy to set up and start using.. works as advertised.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	 	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Love our little dot. I don’t know what the original larger Alexa can do that the dot cannot do but we are pleased with our dots capabilities.	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Really like it	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"Works as expected. This is our fourth one, our son loves it in his room. Easy to set an alarm and he can play music through it."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Love it	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Dislike the volume. It does not sound loud enough.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Love Alexa!!  I own 2 and gave one for a gift which was a huge hit!	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	as expected	1
1	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I didn’t order it	0
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I love this technology. I'm older, but this is so easy to set up and use. I have the dot in my bedroom and use it for everything I use my echo for which is in the living room."	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Use as my 3rd dot. Bought so my husband would be able to contact someone if he falls and doesn't have access to phone.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Amazing product. Still learnimg all the things it can do	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Does what I expected, and more."	1
1	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	The product sounded the same as the emoji speaker from five below my sister has ... and even that one has Bluetooth and doesn’t need to be plugged in. The only good thing about this is that you can speak to it.	0
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I have a friend now.	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	It’s easier to do things with it	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Good device	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Overall love it. There are just some commands which aren't effective. It may be part user error or ""Alexa"" becoming accustom to what is being asked."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"these are additional alexa based devices to make access better from other parts  of our homes rather than trying to shout questions or instructions through out the house, lol. we wouldn't be without alexa for the variety of functions that she performs."	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"Works great, love the fact you can play the same music on a group of devices."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I love it, it is just what I thought it would be!!!  I'm addicted!"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Works beautifully, excellent sound."	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Still learning everything she can do.  Good for a room.  Volume is pretty good without an additional speaker	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	neat tool we enjoy it with the family	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Easy to connect and the skills created for our Echo 2nd Gen worked fine with the Dot.	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"I live alone, this is the best companion!"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Easy to set up and connect with smart devices. Just what I needed!	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"Love it! I personally prefer Spotify music, so it’s great that I was able to set that as default. There’s not a day that goes by without music in our home. Also, the reason we got it is to keep our pup calm when we leave, so we tell Alexa to play some classical music or jazz and it works wonders. He’s a lot more calmer and doesn’t bark when we lock the door and start walking away. It’s a must have!"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Love it.  It works great.  Alexa still has some problems  but it is getting better every day.  I'm not an expert but I think the sound quality is fine.  Not perfect but good.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	This  is my second Echo to purchase -- the price was so cheap -- I'm seriously thinking of buying 2 more -- I use &#34;Alexa&#34; for everything -- it's the next best thing to the internet  :-*	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I love it. bought one for my daughter and one for myself	1
3	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	 	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	It is just not as loud as I thought it was going to be.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I enjoy it. Still discovering new uses.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Being able to add speakers is a plus. I take it on my deck when I am outside. Just love it. I have my big Alexia in my bedroom	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"excellent device , works great, having no problems or concerns"	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	It's pretty fun and nice to have a speaker that responds to my questions but doesn't understand my commands some of the time.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	 	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I like the hands free operation vs the Tap. We use both for controlling smart plugs.	1
3	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I dislike that it confuses my requests all the time.	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	 	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Love my Alexa! Actually have 3 throughout the house. Favorite function is lists. Great for time management and if course, music."	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	This product is easy to use and very entertaining.  I have yet to hook it up to my TV or lights but look forward to doing so.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	 	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	works great but speaker is not the good for music. Will need to get a Bluetooth speaker.	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Outstanding product - easy to use.  works great	1
4	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	We have six of these throughout our home and they are great.  There are times when music or talking happens randomly that may be from sensitive listening.  There should be more options to change the name of the engagement command &#34;Alexa&#34; or &#34;Computer&#34; are a little annoying.  More colors then black and white would also be a good thing.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Use the product for music and it’s great!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Easy to set-up and to use.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	It works great!!	1
4	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	I like having more Alexa devices in my house and the sales price on amazon prime day was too tempting.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	PHENOMENAL	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	I loved it does exactly what it says	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I used it to control my smart home devices. Works great.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Very convenient	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"Este producto llegó y a la semana se quedó sin olor, perdió toda su escencia, huele solo a alcohol"	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Easy to set up Ready to use in minutes.	1
4	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Barry	1
3	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	 	1
4	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	My three year old loves it.  Good for doing basic household tasks.  We're going to add a few smart outlets and bulbs.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Awesome device wish I bought one ages ago.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	love it	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Perfect for kids, adults and everyone in between!!"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Listening to music, searching locations, checking time, looking up weather. There are many more task to learn. It was simple to set up."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I do love these things, i have them running my entire home, TV, all my lights, my thermostat, my front door dead bolt, the cameras... and i love listening to npr. these things are well worth the value and they really shine once you stat adding smart devices and you can control your entire home like its right out of star trek.... I named mine computer to get the feel... but its amazing what you can do with these devices and smart systems."	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"Only complaint I have is that the sound quality isn't great. I mostly use it for commands though, and I have another dot hooked up to my stereo system to play music through. I have a couple friends that have a dot and don't mind the audio quality, but if you're bothered by that kind of thing I'd go with the full size echo or make sure you hook the do up to some larger speakers."	1
4	29-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Good	1
5	29-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Nice little unit  no issues	1
5	31-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"The echo dot was easy to set up and use. It helps provide music, etc. to small spaces and was just what I was looking for."	1
5	31-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I set her up to play through our home theater system. So fat we are just using her for weather forecasts, cooking timers, and we really enjoy the music!"	1
5	31-Jul-18	White  Dot	Small device that my kids like to ask questions. Very handy friendly interactive	1
5	31-Jul-18	Black  Dot	beyond awesome	1
5	31-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I like that it responds every time. It was easy to set up.  I'm still learning what I can do with it. I may like a better speaker more.	1
5	31-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Family loved it!	1
5	31-Jul-18	Black  Dot	 	1
4	31-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I like how it will connect to bluetooth without an adapter like the Google. Only reason for 4 stars is volume level without external speaker. Easy to use.	1
5	31-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Echos are great I have a few of them through out our home .  All in voice range to ask a question. Say a command to turn lights on or off. Or my favorite is play music all though the house.	1
5	31-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Love it , this time it's a gift  for friend"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Fantastic product, I use it as a smart home hub and to play music through speakers mainly, the customizable routines are so nice and very easy to program"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Great	1
1	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I am quite disappointed by this product.There clearly is a bug: half of the time I ask for a newsflash, two second after it starts, the whole thing stops and reboots for a couple of minutes. Same goes when I ask to play the radio. Also, many times it get confused when I ask to switch of &#34;the lights&#34;...as other items are also named the same, which is not true. Clearly no AI or natural language, very 'beta' stage still for me. Not impressed!"	0
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Love this thing works great and kids love it to	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Love it.. makes the simple things in life simpler	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I am really enjoying the many different features on my Alexa, especially listening to music and audio books"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Echo Dot is a wonderful invention. We love it. Alexa is so smart.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Alarm and music, information the weather"	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Love it! Very helpful	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Good but it’s pretty low	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Alarm, calendar, reminders"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I have had the echo dot for about two weeks and am having fun with it. I set morning alarms, check the weather, have Alexa play various music (I bought inexpensive speakers to connect for better sound), and I'm learning her skills. A little tricky to connect to wifi initially, but after some trial and error it connected, and has stayed connected. So far, super satisfied. Will be buying one for my mother and one for my office."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I AM COMPLETELY IN LOVE. DOES ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING AND IS SO AMAZING AND GREAT	1
2	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Nope. Still a lot to be improved. For most of the things we ask.. It says.. Hmmmm.. I dont know that.	0
3	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	The speaker could be better...	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	I love it!!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	3rd Dot. Love it!	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	works like any other one!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Love my new Alexa. She works great so far.	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I bought the echo dot while it was on sale for prime day and I was excited when it came in the next day. I set it up immediately and everything worked perfectly fine. The set up was easy and straight forward which I really appreciated because I am terrible with technology. The only reason why I am not satisfied with my purchase is because of the fact that I can't use the Echo Dot for more than 15 minutes without it disconnecting from the internet. I am connected to both 2.4GHZ and 5GHZ wifi links and neither works. It's very frustrating because I am not getting my use out of the Echo Dot and I really wish I could. If any one has had the same problems or has any solution please let me know!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I got this for dad on father's Day!  He was tickled with it!	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Nice product	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Love my echo. Love playing music in my room	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Still getting used to Alexa, but I think she's a keeper!"	1
4	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Works good for the most part. You ask it some questions and she says she doesn’t know. I thought she was supposed to know everything	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	my new best friend :)	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Absolutely love it!!!!	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I liked linking two more rooms in the home	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I LOVE ALEXA!! SHE ROCKS!!!	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I had some trouble with my echo dot when I first got it because of internet connection issues. After doing research online I saw from some other people that they had trouble with the 2nd generation Echo Dot. However, the same weekend I took a trip and brought my Echo Dot along to the hotel where it seemed to work just fine. Now back home, the internet connection has seemed to have gotten through it's little rough patch and I haven't had any problems since. So, if you are having connection issues with an Echo Dot then it is probably the internet and not the device."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Small size works great in our sunroom.	1
4	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	I like it and it’s helful but it can only do certain thongs that is supported by amazon.	1
1	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I reached out to Amazon, because the device wanted to sync my phone number but it would not allow because it said my number was already in use.  Customer service couldn't help they basically told me to contact Sprint to assist.  So Echo does the bare minimum without access to my phone for set up, so its kind of pointless to have and pay for."	0
3	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"It won’t work as a blue tooth speaker with my tv,it connects but won’t work"	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I've only got to use it for a couple of weeks before having to go into the hospital, but had good time with it for the short time I did use it. It was fun trying to use Alexa"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"This was an impulse buy but turns out I really enjoy my new dot. My grands love requesting songs and playing games. I like listening to my audible selection, keeping up with my to do lists and discovering new Alexa skills. Fun and practical, my echo dot has been a surprisingly welcome addition to my home."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Great product at a great price.	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	My son loves his Echo Dot.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Love these.  Great in the bathroom to listen to the news during showering.  Or listen to CNN live with Serius SM.	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	I like it alot. I connected it so I can play my Pandora and I asked about the weather & time every morning. I got rid of my old fashioned digitol clock because I can have my music play Unlimited on this. I'm going to ask it about vacations and a few other things once I get more comfortable with it. Definitely worth the money.	1
4	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	It plays music that I request.	1
1	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I didn't like that almost everytime i asked Alexa a question she would say i dont know that or i havent learned that.	0
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Luv it.  It's a great product.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"What can I say. Well, I’m a  paranoid IT person of 30 years but got hooked on the idea of cloud based home control. So yes I love my echo stuff but, I did create a isolated VLAN on my home network to run the devices including the cheap ones that require you to sign up on some questionable website and download their app. Be carful with these people!  Entering your Wi-Fi password on a site that’s not vetted and your location when the app askes is not a good thing. Try to stay with devices that  work directly with the Alexa hub with no third-party app, Amazon has more control of these types of devices and how the  sensitive information is handled."	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Great product	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Very helpful for playing music, setting alarms, and talking to you when you are lonely."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Easy to set up, can control Kasa smart plugs no problem.  Even the kids have figured stuff out that I would not have asked Alexa, like telling jokes and singing. The Alexa app controls my custom spark plug and my cloud cam."	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I love having Alexa around the house. My favorite features are her timers, alarms, and music. Especially her library of sleep sounds. I got this product as a gift for my kids, and they love her too. She is great for reading time, and timing 30 minutes for it.The only thing I really don't like, is that she HAS to be plugged in to an outlet to function. No ifs ands, or buts. I get why, but it is minorly inconvenient, as I have to move her from room to room, or purchase more. Lol"	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"Alarm,bed time story, universal"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I am in love with alexa	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Its was easy to set up	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	 	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Works better than anticipated. This thing is awesome.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Great product	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Really like it	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	I like that it respond most of my comands. Great product.	1
1	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	The volume is very low	0
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	so far i am liking it although i am probably not using it to the full capasity	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"My new best friend!! I'm a little behind the times I've never had anything like this, another alexa or google home, so to me this is a super amazing useful tool. I use it to play sleep sounds to sleep. I use it for my amazon audible books. Set alarms, reminders, receive notifications, play games with her. Have her tell me a short story lol. It's pretty fun. I know some people complained about the speaker I'm not sure why. I'm sure if you have an open concept house all to yourself and want to blast music no this might not blast it around loud enough. But I rent a room and in my bedroom it's perfect I don't have any problems with the speaker. Love everything about it!"	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Wish volume was capable of going louder	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I love it	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Best purchase this year.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I love these, I have 2 dots and one echo. For a medium size rooms these are loud enough without external speakers although I do use external for the dots."	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I really love my dots! So awesome how it’s connects all my rooms. But like you’ve read with other reviews they are definitely lower in volume. Which I’m sure if I connected it to speaker or another device it would be great. But as a stand alone the volume is just ok. Definitely not like my tall echo. And the dots don’t pick up voice as good as my tall echo.Still totally love them and would recommend 100%	1
3	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	its okay but keeps dropping wifi!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Kids love it! I love it!	1

5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Fun To interact with	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Very satisfied with the product	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"We have 3 echos now, even one in the barn, great idea for when I am working with my horse, can still get news flashes & my music!"	1
3	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I bought this for my healing room.  I play continuous spa like music. Although Alexa knows the type of music needed, the device does not deliver quality sound it sounds muffled.  I didn't know I had to buy speakers too."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Like having the music where ever I am.	1
3	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"Hard to hear, had to blue tooth it to a better speaker."	1
3	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"No problems, works as expected. Could have a better speaker."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I love it...... I want to get another one very  very  soon	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Great to have along with the Echo	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	this is my 2nd echo dot and it is working just as i want it to.  i have it in the bedroom and i par it with a small blue tooth speaker.  last nite i went to sleep with sounds of a thunderstorm as provided by my echo dot.  i am planning to have the dot turn my bedroom lamps on when i receive the smart plugs that i ordered.	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"daughter wanted a white boombox, nothing good out for 11 yr old.  decided to go echo dot for most any request + white BT good speaker.  she loved the gift and nice option for many things on the internet."	1
1	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Cheap and cheap sound.	0
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	This is pretty cool	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Some times Alexa is a little &#34;thick&#34;, but mostly good!"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Love it!! Don’t know what took me so long to get one — and don’t know why I didn’t get two on Amazon Prime Day!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Up dated news	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Works like a champ.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Clear sound, great alarm clock, plays my music.  What else can you ask for.  Oh yeah, you can order what you need."	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Love that you can use your cell phone to call Echo or Dot. You can also use Echo and Dot as intercoms.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	love it...just like the other 4 I own.	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"Great price.  I love my echo dot,"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Excellent. Bought another one yesterday!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	works great	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Love this!!! My daughter enjoys telling Alexa what to do. Haha	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Purchased this for a discount on Prime Day to insert into a portable Bluetooth speaker made specifically to work with Echo Dot. Works great, love it! Now I can bring Alexa out onto the patio with me, and I mostly use it for music. This is our 3rd Echo product and we love them!"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Just got my third one. Love them	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	The ease in installing	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Un excelente equipo inteligente al estar conectado al internet nos provee de múltiples funciones tales como, el tiempo,hora,información de cualquier estudio que estés realizando atrás vez del internet."	1
2	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"For the price, the product is nice quality and has a few nice features. So definitely no complaints there. The reason why I only gave it 3 stars is because the echo dot is not what I thought it was going to be so that may just be buyer error. First, I didn’t know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work. So I really don’t like that it’s not a stand alone device. Also, the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a Bluetooth speaker, don’t. Lastly, I’m sure the echo dot can do a lot but I haven’t quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own, plus setting it up was awful. I would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually “Alexa”."	0
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I love this product so far only because of the few things I can do with it...such as set a timer, a reminder, play music and games. I don't like that to get the full enjoyment from it that you have to purchase so many things. It was also very difficult to set up. The directions made it sound as simple as one, two, three but they forgot about step four, five and six. I was almost ready to send to back.The app is extremely slow and it took hours to get this thing set up. However depending on what you are going to be using it for I think it's an ok item."	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Love the echo dot it’s amaxing!!!	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I like to use it for listening to podcasts.  I like to set up the greeting in the morning to tell me what's new.  The one thing I don't like was getting it to recognize the radio station I wanted to listen to.  I finally got it working, but had to work through the bugs."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Just like it's big sister, the Echo, only smaller, with slightly less audio fidelity, but much lower price (on amazon prime day:-)Used in another room to add Alexa to an additional room."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	It does everything  the big guy does	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Great product - understands my accent!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Love it... can't stop using it..	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Really like the availability to get instant music throughout the house.	1
3	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	 	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"very handy in the kitchen, sets timer and gives me extra help on setting oven temps."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Cool little speaker..I love her alarms and connected it to my speakers and it sounds great!!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	It is s great tool helping with information.	1
1	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Used twice not working!!!!!!!	0
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Awesome piece of technology that has simplified my life. Great purchase.	1
3	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I jumped on the bandwagon by purchasing an Echo.  I feel like there was a struggle getting connected and then three days later, the device is sharing news and weather.  Now we use it some, but have not tapped in to all options.  Still testing it out."	1
4	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Love Alexa. Love the Echo Dot but we have trouble with the speakers when using the intercom.	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"Love it , Now if I can only find the correct smart (links)Plug to connect this too"	1
4	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Work pretty well	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Still learning it	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"We really love our Echo Dot, we can get questions answered right away and play any music we can think of."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Usual reliable Alexa	1
3	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Speaker could be better qualty	1
1	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	This device does not interact with my home filled with Apple devices.  How disappointing!	0
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Have the echo wanted something smaller in another room  they work together great	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Love it!! It is so handy and easy to use. Got it for my classroom, but I many need to just get another one."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Very pleased	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Primarily for music in our bedroom.  I wish the speaker had better fidelity.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Nice	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Music, weather, time."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Great, love it!"	1
2	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Not all that happy. The speaker isn’t great and for some reason a lot of times when I play music it will start to make some weird noise and just stop. My son has a google home and it is much better	0
3	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Not impressed	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I really like it .	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	it takes a while to learn the uses and I'm still learning!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Alexa is phenomenal!	1
2	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"When you think about it this really doesn’t do much. Play music, answer stupid questions, finally it was able to hook up to thermostat. I can see why price is dropping like a rock."	0
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"The Echo Dot (2nd Generation) Smart Speaker is very compound in size, however it  projects very good sound. It also has a port in which you can connect an external speaker  for greater projection of sound. I also like it size because it's not awkward, and it doesn't take up a lot of space. It works great with the Alexa App. I also think the size is great for college students who live in dorm rooms with small limited spacing."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I use the echo dot several different ways in my home. I use it downstairs to control lighting. I also take it out on my deck to stream music to a Bluetooth speaker. It works great for what I need.	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	I have an echo but wanted a dot for my bedroom. It was even easier to set up than my original echo.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Makes turning on and off things in the house so simple. Great for little updates as well, like checking the weather and such."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Great product, fun to use!!"	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Needs to be smarter	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I really enjoy being able to just make a request  for my favorite music and it happens I have no complaints at this time...	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Love it. Works great making my home a smarthome	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	I really like the echo dot. It’s amazing to be able to set an alarm or timer just by talking to the echo dot.	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Convenient and fun.	1
4	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	It's alright....	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	this is my first Alexa enabled device and so far its lived up to its reputation!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I love searching the Alexa skill shop on the app. Useful things like having Alexa turn my lights on and off, listening to news updates every morning. And fun stuff like telling Alexa to make the Star Trek red alert nois. Or playing song quiz with friends."	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Second dot.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Son loves it.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I love how compact it is.	1
1	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"This worked well for about 6 months but then stopped connecting to the internet (wifi) and none of the trouble shooting efforts worked.  Amazon customer service couldn't help further and told me warranty was only 3 months, which was very disappointing, so they weren't willing to replace."	0
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"It talks to me, plays the type of music i want to listen to, and even turns off when I ask if to."	1
2	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Ask it to play Motown radio on Pandora and it keeps asking if I want to add a salsa station. Motown isn’t close to salsa phonetically.	0
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Love it, we are still learning the capabilities, having a lot of fun."	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Easy to set up. Still trying to get it to connect to a light bulb smart plug. Grandkids think Alex is cool!	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	I love it! I use it for everything. It’s a part of my daily routine	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"The Alexa program is great, but the quality is not the best. It could definitely be louder."	1
4	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Overall I like this. Though Siri on my phone can do more for what I need as I don’t have a “smart home” and don’t intend to make it one. But it’s fun and I use it for music and to have it read me my audible books.	1
3	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Alexa is pretty basic and almost like a toy. Shouldn't have been released into the market without proper development. Speech recognition fails to understand basic American and British Accent.The music it can play is very restrictive. Speech isn't refined in a way that we understand a (almost a) human is speaking. Linking to Youtube via amazon web services doesn't work.	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Set up is so easy.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Love it	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I'm amazed with the alarm. I tell Alexa to wake me up to a particular song and it does.  I love the play list if music. Not sure if i don't keep prime if music will still be available. However i did love the fact Amazon gave me music free for 3 months...they should have given prime free for 3 months as well.	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	I love all of the things that it can do. I can play with it and learn from it.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Been debating on getting one, but am happy I did! Still more to explore. Thanks!"	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"I'm finding more and more uses for this all the time. It keeps me informed with news and weather, I can get a daily Bible verse, and have it play music. New skills are added all the time. The future is here!"	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	I love to watch my wife argue with Alexa.  I woke up one night listening to Alexa talking to my cell phone. ????	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	 	1

4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Gave as a gift - they loved it.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	The Echo Dot was everything that I expected and more.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I love this its super convenient and makes my life a little easier	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"I love my echo dot. Has many features and works great.The only thing I don't like about it, is that I can't play my iMusic on it. I'm going to have to pay for a Spotify or Amazon music account."	1
4	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Its Great. Lots Of Fun!!	1
4	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"Easy setup. Alexa needs a lot of training,"	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Third echo dot purchased. Love the product.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I like the compact structure of the Dot. The sound is a little too low.	1
4	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"Handy if you don't expect much out of it much ""dumber"" than the assistant in my phone."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	It's easy to set up and use. There are new features and skills added all the time.	1
3	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Love the product but dislike that I can’t sync up my Apple Music for Alexa to play	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Have had for just one week so far and I can say it is a blast to have.	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	love it	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Works like a charm.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Good speaker for bedroom or office	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Small speaker tin sound. Great with good Bluetooth speaker.	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Fun and  information.  No dislikes  so far !! Like the convenience!!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	It was easy to set up and affordable! Love it!	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	I love that I can shut the microphone off at night so my children can’t talk to it at bed time and she has an automatic sleep timer for their lullaby music. Not sure how I survived with out this for so long.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Echo Dot and related devices are the best thing to come in a long time.	1
3	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"The sound quality wasn’t great, but it was inexpensive"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Works great... bought it for my shop so that it is like an intercom to the house.	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	It isn’t bad for what it is. Have issues with it actually playing what I want. Getting it use iHeartRadio properly by playing the station I want is a challenge but it’s not bad for the sale price I paid.	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	It’s great but sound quality is very low	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	I love it.	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"As Always, easy to set up"	1
3	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	It works OK. This speaker quality is not much better than my iPhone X. I would spend the extra money to get the full-size echo which has great sound quality.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Very intelligent, love the songs ...."	1
4	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Review	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I love my Echo Dot!  The price I paid during Prime Day was comparable to buying a new digital clock with the bells and whistles, but this does so much more.  I can play music, set alarms, call friends, play games, set timers...the list goes on and on.  Definitely worth the money."	1
2	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Sound is terrible. Cannot pair with echo to play simultaneously.  Must upgrade to amazon music if you want to play more than one device at a time.	0
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Easy installation and set up. Better sound from the Echo Dot Smart speaker. Very satisified with purchase.	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"I am spoiled by one downstairs...so got this one for upstairs to listen to music , etc. while I walked on the treadmill."	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	 	1
3	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	The commands Alexa requires are too specific.  I find Google home to be much more flexible in figuring out what I'm asking for.	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	HANDY AS HELL 10/10 RECOMMEND	1
1	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	I am having real difficulty working with the Echo Dot. Alexi is not very smart. 9 out of 10 questions I have asked I get the &#34;I'm not sure&#34;  Half the time I am still asking the question and Alexi is saying &#34;I'm not sure&#34;. The music is great and works well for that. All in All so far it's been a very frustrating experience.	0
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"We are still in the discovery phase, but so far we are enjoying the smart home features we have installed."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Totally gets out sense of humour	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	We put one in the bedroom.  It plays music and tells us the weather.  It also is an alarm to wake us up in the morning.  It is better than a clock radio.  It will play any type of music you want from radio stations or your own favorites.  It can even tell jokes.  I don't know how I got along without it before now.  Amazing.	1
3	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I like the Echo, but not sure about the Dot.  I use it a lot for music and Audio books.The sound quality of this smaller Echo is nowhere near the quality of the full sized model.  I haven't decided if I'll keep it or not!"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	LOVE it. I got this for my boyfriend for his birthday and his kids have a blast asking Alexa all kinds of questions and having her tell silly jokes. We love it.	1
4	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Better sound.	1
3	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Got this for my 2nd Echo in the house, I already have the regular Echo.  The Echo Dot was easy to set up but the sound is not enjoyable, wishing I would have just gone with another regular Echo solely based on sound."	1
1	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I was really happy with my original echo so i thought I'd get an echo dot to use in my bedroom. I was really disappointed in the audio quality so I connected an external speaker via bluetooth. The audio was much better but I started having problems with it loosing connection with the wifi, presumably due to interference from the bluetooth. Then  I connected a speaker via the auxiliary jack. when i did that, the auxiliary jack picked up interference from the wifi and I was woken up in the middle of the night by a horrible buzzing sound. im hoping Amazon will take this thing back and give me a good deal on an echo spot which I hope will be a better nightstand device."	0
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Listens well, does way more than expected, love her!"	1
4	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"We are still testing this one out and so far, we like it. I was very hesitant about putting a voice activated device in our home and this would be our first. Unfortunately, it sometimes gets our WiFi light bulbs mixed up and won't turn them on but we've been able to manage and fix it. I mean, it's convenient, especially for those unable to reach to turn off lights or electronics that you could hook up to the Dot. I do like that it plays music and has reminders, alarms, etc - I'm just still getting used to the fact that The Man is always listening now."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Works great.Having fun playing music,checking weather,a king questions."	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Small convenient and dependable. This dot is a cutie and Alexa does the job you ask.My only issue is the fidelity which is to be expected in a such a small speaker	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Alexa is perfect for people like me living alone. At least I have someone to talk to.. to keep my sanity. 😂 Though I wish it has a powerful speaker and no need to connect it to bluetooth speakers.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	small footprint.  nice clarity.	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Easy set up	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Great addition to my Alexa base. Using it in my guest bedroom for music, clock and info.Dot speaker is not as strong as the base but it's a great value"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I had an Alexia built into my thermostat that just didn't work very well. I had to be standing right next to it for it to hear me and music played very choppy on it. I decided to try the Echo Dot since it was on Prime Day. I have not been disappointed! It hears me just fine and music plays with out any problem. I really like that I can Bluetooth connect to my Bose Speaker for quality sound.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I connected it to my whole home sound system to play prime music which my Google Home mini can't do.  It works well.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	this is so much fun to play with - I just ask to set an alarm to wake in the morning and when it goes off I tell Alexa to turn it of - Alexa learns from the questions I ask. SHe will play music that you ask her to play if its the amazon music domain. If I wake up in the middle of the night I do not have to turn on a light I just ask alexa what time is it. When I want the current weather she tells me. Ask her what going on in the city she knows. Call a friend she will dial ( I haven't used that one yet but she said she could if its in y contacts.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Easy to set up and does everything it’s a poster. Despite its small size the speakers are adequate. Understands instructions from across the room. Very happy with the purchase.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"A great product for the price, works well!!"	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Perfect for a home office	1
2	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Weak sound. Compared to the Google Home Mini the sound is bad. Also you need Prime to have a small selection of music and need prime music to play everything. Also if you get two you need prime family music to play music on both. I think it's lame that you need a family plan to use multiple devices.	0
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	It does what it's suppose to do great product.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I love this item and being able to hear any kind of music.  I enjoyed it so much that I ordered another.	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Love the dot	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Great item.  I'm so glad I made the purchase and on Prime day.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I'm still learning how to use it.  I figured out it can read my kindle books to me, which is a real bonus."	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Love having one in our bedroom and in the kitchen. Great to drop in on family around the house.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"So far so good.  Not to tech savvy so, I'm still trying to figure out what I can do with it but, it was easy to set up and so far easy to use.  Lots of apps that it can use.  I will have to play with it some more but its fun to have."	1
1	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Echo Dot responds to us when we aren't even talking to it. I've unplugged it. It feels like it's &#34;spying&#34; on us.	0
1	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	NOT CONNECTED TO MY PHONE PLAYLIST :(	0
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I had put this off for awhile but finally got around to buying 3 of them for my home. My wife is legally blind and cannot use the computer. This has been a Godsend, 100%. We have the Amazon music for her and now she can listen to music, check the weather, get phone numbers, make calls, etc., etc.. We are still learning but I tell you, this is absolutely amazing. I purchased 4 more for my extended family and the grandchildren absolutely love playing their music on Alexa. With the wifi and direct cable capability, the speaker/stereo options are there for the choosing. This is well worth the money. You won't regret this at all!"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Perfect!  Fast shipment and packaging.  Worked as intended.	1
3	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Alexa seems to get dumber and less useful all the time	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Love it!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I'm addicted to this thing.	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I love my Dot and am hoping to add a couple more around the apartment. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish the speaker would be just a little better. I know Amazon probably wanted to keep costs down for this item but I really like to play music around the apartment when I am busy doing things so if they would have added a speaker with just a little more wattage and bass response they would have something great to put in the bathroom or kitchen where there might not be a lot of space for a full sized Echo. I would have been willing to pay 10 to 20 dollars more if it had a better speaker. Oh well it is what it is and I still love it. I'm just going to have to find a Bluetooth speaker that sounds good but doesn't take up a whole lot of space.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	So far all.i can say is I love it	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Love my dots.  Easy to use.  I have two plus the Echo Spot.  One of my favorite features is the ability to listen to music ... AMAZON, IHeart Radio, Pandora."	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Great to play music throughout the house. Great and easily fits in my decor of my home	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"I'm obsessed with Alexa. She tells me the weather every morning, she can play games (we love the guess the song one!) and the one we have upstairs can turn off our TV downstairs which is so cool because why walk down the stairs if Alexa will do it for you????"	1
3	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Works well. Just disappointed with the speaker quality. But hooked it up to old computer speakers.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Easy setup, easy use, work with other smart products, always learning what it can do"	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	We have so much fun with this!  So easy to use that even my four year old loves talking to Alexa!!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I love my new Echo Dot! Right now, I mainly use it to play music at night, but it gets the job done."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"We love this thing! I wish I would have gotten it sooner. You will certainly want to go through the settings and lock it down if you have kids, but it is a great additional for even unexpected things like helping the kids with homework. There are loads of skills. I am very happy with this purchase, especially since I got it on prime day for almost half price."	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Super easy to hook up and program. I use the music feature the most but I love how I can set reminders from my phone and my Echo will remind me at the set time. It’s great for my news updates too!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	It works just like my other Dots.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Set up was simple. It recognizes my voice well. It seams very intuitive. I am enjoying its ease of use.	1
2	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	The only negative we have on this product is the terrible sound quality.  A massive difference from the Alexa.  Which to us was a big reason we wanted to purchase this.Won’t be buying another until the speaker and sound quality can improve.	0
3	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	I was hoping the cord was white also. Otherwise it is fine.	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"I like that she has the ability to do multiple different things like create a to do list, set and alarm, play any song I can think of and much more. I wish the sound could be a tad louder."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Too soon, I'm still learning what I can do with it."	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Enjoying it and still learning all the commands.  Ran into one frustrating issue.  It was not user friendly when trying to set up voice recognition for a household.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I love the option where u can play music everywhere in the house when you have multiple devices	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Works great!	1
4	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	I like almost everything	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"AMAZING. It has helped me become better organized, gives me traffic updates, weather updates, and helps me maintain a good, fast morning routine."	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"My kids love Alexa... Skills are amazing, would like to see her get a little smarter answering basic questions"	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Great. Definitely gets a little old after a while but for $30 I can't really regret it at all. Love having it hooked up to my speakers via bluetooth and waking up to The Smiths.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Love it. Added it to an upstairs bedroom	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Got to love Alexa she does everything around our house	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Works great and easy to set up!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	My 3rd echo device. Very easy to set up. Works perfectly.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Easy to set up and start using.. works as advertised.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	 	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Love our little dot. I don’t know what the original larger Alexa can do that the dot cannot do but we are pleased with our dots capabilities.	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Really like it	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"Works as expected. This is our fourth one, our son loves it in his room. Easy to set an alarm and he can play music through it."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Love it	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Dislike the volume. It does not sound loud enough.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Love Alexa!!  I own 2 and gave one for a gift which was a huge hit!	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	as expected	1
1	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I didn’t order it	0
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I love this technology. I'm older, but this is so easy to set up and use. I have the dot in my bedroom and use it for everything I use my echo for which is in the living room."	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Use as my 3rd dot. Bought so my husband would be able to contact someone if he falls and doesn't have access to phone.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Amazing product. Still learnimg all the things it can do	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Does what I expected, and more."	1
1	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	The product sounded the same as the emoji speaker from five below my sister has ... and even that one has Bluetooth and doesn’t need to be plugged in. The only good thing about this is that you can speak to it.	0
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I have a friend now.	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	It’s easier to do things with it	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Good device	1
4	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Overall love it. There are just some commands which aren't effective. It may be part user error or ""Alexa"" becoming accustom to what is being asked."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"these are additional alexa based devices to make access better from other parts  of our homes rather than trying to shout questions or instructions through out the house, lol. we wouldn't be without alexa for the variety of functions that she performs."	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"Works great, love the fact you can play the same music on a group of devices."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"I love it, it is just what I thought it would be!!!  I'm addicted!"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	"Works beautifully, excellent sound."	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	Still learning everything she can do.  Good for a room.  Volume is pretty good without an additional speaker	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	neat tool we enjoy it with the family	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Easy to connect and the skills created for our Echo 2nd Gen worked fine with the Dot.	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"I live alone, this is the best companion!"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Easy to set up and connect with smart devices. Just what I needed!	1
5	30-Jul-18	White  Dot	"Love it! I personally prefer Spotify music, so it’s great that I was able to set that as default. There’s not a day that goes by without music in our home. Also, the reason we got it is to keep our pup calm when we leave, so we tell Alexa to play some classical music or jazz and it works wonders. He’s a lot more calmer and doesn’t bark when we lock the door and start walking away. It’s a must have!"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Love it.  It works great.  Alexa still has some problems  but it is getting better every day.  I'm not an expert but I think the sound quality is fine.  Not perfect but good.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	This  is my second Echo to purchase -- the price was so cheap -- I'm seriously thinking of buying 2 more -- I use &#34;Alexa&#34; for everything -- it's the next best thing to the internet  :-*	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I love it. bought one for my daughter and one for myself	1
3	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	 	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	It is just not as loud as I thought it was going to be.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	I enjoy it. Still discovering new uses.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Black  Dot	Being able to add speakers is a plus. I take it on my deck when I am outside. Just love it. I have my big Alexia in my bedroom	1
