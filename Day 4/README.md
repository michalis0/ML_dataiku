-----------------------------------
### **Step 1: Regression:**
-----------------------------------

- **a.** Create a new project: "Clustering: Customer Dataset".
- **b.** To perform clustering, please first import the dataset dataset **"4_clustering_dataset_cleaned"**, which can be found [here]() and click on the **"lab"** tab and click on **"AutoML prediction"**. Please select the **"target_medv"** which corresponds to the target variable. Now please select **"Quick Prototypes"** and press **"CREATE"**.
- **c.**This is the space where we will be training the Machine Learning model ! **Before clicking on "TRAIN"**, we will have a look at how the model is initialized. Please click on **"DESIGN"** and navigate to **"Algorithms"**. Please select the first model that we will use: **Ridge Regression**. In the **DESIGN** section, you can see differnent tabs: 
    -  **BASIC - Target:** We model the problem as a Regression and our target variable is "target_revenue"
    - **BASIC - Train / Test Set:** This allows us to control how the dataset is split into a training and testing set, we can modify that ratio
    - **BASIC - Metric:** In our case, we are interested in the R2 Score
    - **Modeling - Algorithms:** Here we can define the different algorithms we want to define for our Regression, we can also define the hyperparameters for our models

Now please click **"TRAIN"**. (It should look like [this](https://github.com/michalis0/ML_dataiku/blob/main/Day%202/HELP/models.png)). What is the accuracy ? (expected: [0.753](https://github.com/michalis0/ML_dataiku/blob/main/Day%202/HELP/accuracy_model.png))

**Issues with the plugin**
(To install the plugin, open the  Apps menu, click Plugins and search for Graph analytics. Should look something like this. Install the plugin)
